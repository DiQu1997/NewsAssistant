       "   'content': \"6 As I wrote here on Sunday May 10, 2020, the report of the 2012 Presidential Committee on Restructuring and Rationalisation of Federal Government Parastatals, Commissions and Agencies also known as the Oronsaye Panel Report, is a significant public document, which neither time nor event can obliterate from my memory as a document-minded journalist. I would like to restate without hesitation that if the Tinubu administration can handle current recourse to the report well, it can actually be a game changer as I have written several times on the document. Below is an excerpt from what I wrote on the report in 2020 as part of agenda setting for the Buhari administration. ‘I would like to declare with all sense of responsibility that if the Jonathan administration that set up the committee had implemented the organic recommendations in the report, that would have begun the process of transforming the public service in Nigeria. Doubtless, the cost of governance, which has become a huge burden for the Buhari administration would have been part of our history. Hold your breadth, even ASUU members would have been proud members of Nigeria’s academic community. I mean tertiary education and indeed the university administration generally too would have been made easier and more productive. The report reveals that a larger percentage of official budget to the tertiary institutions is spent on non-academic activities and non-academic staff. It is still a mystery how some forces of darkness around the Jonathan administration distracted him from this remarkable, yes well researched document with relevant data on ‘reinventing the public sector in Nigeria’. This is a time to interview former President Jonathan to speak to the mystery of his simplicity that led to the docility, which paralysed him from implementing the two important documents – that would have made him a hero of democracy beyond accepting defeat in 2015. I am talking of the 2012 ‘Oronsaye Panel Report’ and the 2014 ‘National Conference Report’. Let me add this here: those who aspire to lead Nigeria out of the present darkness should look for the organic report and study it. It is full of details for serious minded technocrats who would like to study ‘The trouble with the public service in Nigeria’. There is no bombast in the document. It is a masterpiece by those who believe that indeed facts are sacred. Such patriots who would like to be part of rebuilding the ‘Federal Republic of the Nigerian Army’ called Nigeria, should study this report. Don’t mind analysts who have not seen the report…’ This is one of the benefits of the Hurricane Covid-19, that has triggered recourse to the rejected stone that has become a cornerstone: the Oronsaye Panel’s Report. I just want to sensitise public-spirited people who may have been discouraged about the Buhari administration. Sorry, this is not a time of despair. Not is it a time of lamentation, which I have always declared here is not a strategy to deal with any challenges. It is a time to think of what to do to help our President Buhari, lest we will all suffer consequences of collapse of the public sector. Don’t get it twisted, corruption fight can’t be won unless the public sector is rejigged to deal with the monster that has diminished Nigeria’s stature. This is not the first time that I have dealt with the important document here. I mention this regularly on different platforms including the famous Journalists Hangout on TVC…’ Specifically, on April 28, and May 5, 2019, in a serialised article here titled Buhari, Governors and Cabinets of Significance (1&2), I dwelt extensively on this document, which would have been a difference maker in Buhari administration. Lest we forget, the first part of the articles appeared on April 28 while the president was prepared to travel to the U.K where it was speculated he would work on his cabinet list. It was indeed a paradox of development that out President actually did exactly the opposite of what was suggested when he increased the number of ministries and cost of governance. I noted then, ‘…This is the right time to encourage our leaders at all levels, notably the president, the governors and national assembly leaders who are on the verge of dissolving old cabinets, advisory boards and making new ones to consider the time and the season that are shaping our destiny in the country at the moment. Elections are over. It is time for governance. So, from the office of the citizen should flow constructive suggestions on how to evaluate the effects of the rains that have been beating us since 1999 generally and specifically since 2015. It may not be a time to share blames. But our leaders should not entertain sycophants at this time. They should be prepared to listen to some voices of wisdom, which an ancient word says is the principal thing. That word says if you are blessed with wisdom, that power (of wisdom) will promote you in any office you occupy and that same power from above will decorate you ‘with ornament of grace’. That is why leaders need to ask for wisdom, which is different from knowledge or high intelligence quotient. Young readers need to note this distinction… The consequences of the quality of presidential and gubernatorial bureaucracies appointed four years ago have been visible. The implications of the quality of security and intelligence chiefs, chief executives of agencies and others procured in 2015, too have been glaring. The consequences of the quality and quantity of the executive councils of the federation and the states (cabinets) since 2015 have been reflecting in so many indices and the way the citizens and indeed the world have perceived us. As I noted the other day here, ‘it is a period of consequences’. Whatever our leaders sowed into their appointments since 2015, we have been reaping. Some of our fathers have sown and eaten sour grapes and so their children’s teeth have been set on edge… I also added then: We can begin process of rebuilding our broken walls too by suggesting to the president wherever he is making his appointments. The simple suggestion is that he should this time consider a cabinet of significance to the country. The cabinet he made in 2015 was with due respect what Benjamin Disraeli once described as ‘a cabinet of mediocrities’. One is not too sure even the president has been proud of his (2015-2019) cabinet – that has not been remarkable, anyway. I hope people are aware that those of us in the newsroom have to sometimes use Google to find the names of some ministers and heads of agencies of this government. They have neither been prominent, nor significant. This is not peculiar to Abuja alone. We are quick to fire some regular shots at Abuja only, without considering the fact that there are other 37 centres of the peripheries and 774 local government councils in the federation. Here was the clincher then on Oronsaye Panel Report: …If the party system were working, there would be reflection of the ruling party’s programmes in most parts of the country. But we are developing our own peculiar democracy without an ideological road map known as manifestos. That is why I would like to recommend immediately that the president’s good men should dust up the abandoned Steve Oronsaye Panel Report. It is one of the best documents that I have read and kept as a public service journalist. It can be dispassionately studied as a policy document by any good government. The 2012 ‘Presidential Committee on Reforms of Government Agencies’ Report’ can be adopted to restructure the public sector for efficiency and development. There should be no argument about the profile of Chairman of the panel that wrote that significant document. The 800-page report submitted to President Goodluck Jonathan in April 2012, is a classic on efficiency, prudence and lean government at all levels. It is not about Oronsaye. It is about the content of the document – that can be used to transform public service. For instance, the panel recommended the reduction of statutory agencies of government from 263 to 161. Besides, the Oronsaye panel did not see any reason why NTA, FRCN and VOA should be separate entities with three directors-general and three boards of directors. The panel would like the three media outfits to be merged and headed by one director general as it is with the BBC, U.K and SABC, South Africa, etc. I am aware most government agencies’ heads then compromised the White Paper Committee – to remain as entities. And president Jonathan was careless about this remarkable document that would have reformed the public sector significantly before 2015. The reason for a specific reference to Oronsaye Report is that this is not a time for big government. It is not a time for more ministries and agencies, especially as revenue has been dwindling and oil remains a major source of revenue for all the states and local governments. Meanwhile, there have been dark hints that the president would likely expand his cabinet in line with the promise he made to members and officials of his political party the All Progressives Congress (APC) in October 2017, during the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Party. He had then disclosed his intention to expand his cabinet. “Apart from appointing one minister from each of the 36 states as enshrined in the constitution, the president would also pick one person from each of the six geo-political zones in the country,” one of the sources had hinted. The source added that more ministries would be created and others split in line with the exigencies of the moment. The plan in the new cabinet, it was learnt, would also enable the president accommodate some governors who lost their second term bids and senior party faithful who couldn’t secure seats in the National Assembly. This is a time to encourage the president to consider the absurdity of allocating more than 70 per cent of the national budget to recurrent expenditure just for public servants and political office holders. This is a time for his party officials to put heads together on prudent management of the nation’s resources. The president needs to cut costs by merging ministries, agencies and even embassies we don’t need. He needs to talk of Nigeria first, not party men first. That is the significant commitment that has made Donald Trump to be both prominent and significant as a leader in America and indeed the world today despite all the bashings by the opposition and the powerful media. He says he will do all that is needed to fight the opposition and indeed the trading partners just to put America first. So, President Tinubu should be watchful: there are still corrupt public servants who sabotaged the implementation of the remarkable report from Jonathan, through Buhari to the present. Here is the thing, the report is although stale, the essentials of the content can be used to reset the public service that isn’t serving public interest at this time. It shouldn’t be about reduction of cost of governance alone, it should also be about efficiency of the public service and the education sector. You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"President Bola Tinubu yesterday kicked off his official engagements during the two day State Visit to the State of Qatar with a visit to the Museum in Doha. President Tinubu had before his engagements met with key ministers and top government officials last Friday night. Those at the meeting called to strategise for engagement with the hosts included Wale Edun, Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy; Dele Alake, Minister of Solid Minerals Development; Yusuf Tuggar, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Doris Uzoka-Anite, Minister of Trade and Investment; Jamila Ibrahim, Minister of Youth Development and Ali Pate, Minister of Health and Coordinating Minister of Social Welfare. The investment drive is on the sidelines of the State Visit at the invitation of Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar. Mohammed saad Al Rumaihi, the CEO of Qatar Museums and Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Hamad Al Thani, the Director of National Museum of Qatar, are two officials that met and conducted the Nigerian leader around the facilities. The Museum, which was recently redesigned ahead of the 2022 FIFA world Cup, offers visitors access to a variety of materials used in Islamic art, including carpets and textiles, manuscripts, ceramics, wood, ivory, metalwork, stone and glass. President Tinubu is expected to see pieces of materials dating back to the earliest Islamic period from the 20th century, spanning Spain and North Africa to the Far East. The host is also expected to conduct his visitor to view the early Hijazi Quran fragments, the sitara of the Holy Kaaba, the Moroccan arch, a copy of al-Sufi’s treatise on the fixed stars, the Abbasid blue-and-white bowl, the Seljuq stucco panel, the Doha Hind and the post-Islamic Spanish ceiling. Visit to the Museum, heralds other events and would culminate in the signing of agreements in eight areas today between Nigeria and the Qatari government. From the Museum, President Tinubu will visit the Qatar Foundation responsible for promoting Qatar government humanitarian activities in other countries, including Nigeria. The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development is a state-led non-profit organisation in Qatar. The institution, which was founded in 1995 by the then Emir of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his second wife Moza bint Nasser Al-Missne, has been linked to development of schools, houses and health facilities in several countries, including Nigeria. The Foundation helped Nigeria with infrastructure including schools, residential houses and health facilities in states ravaged by insecurity. President Tinubu will later present a trophy to the winner of a Longine organised horse competition in the company of his hosts. Also today, President Tinubu will engage the business community and join his host at the Palace of the Emir of Qatar for the signing of agreements. Governor Uba Sani of Kaduna State, who is on the President’s entourage to Doha, and other Ministers who spoke with journalists, expressed deep appreciation to their host for providing the opportunities to engage with the Qatar investors and look forward to a rewarding experience. He cited the areas of agriculture, particularly, livestock farming as one of the most important areas that Nigeria business community can benefit from. Sani noted that Nigeria’s solid minerals development plans will also get a boost as a result of the engagements, especially by the sub-national governments. “The Qatar Foundation has only five months ago invested millions of dollars to support the under privileged people in Kaduna State, by building hundreds of houses, hospitals for the less privileged people. Kaduna State is also looking at a strong partnership in the solid minerals sector as the state is blessed with lithium and gold. These, including the area of livestock development, are areas we can collaborate with the Qatar government,” Sani said. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tuggar, said Nigeria expects a strong partnership between the two countries going forward, as Qatar, which is the third largest gas producer, seeks to open up investment opportunities for the Nigerian business community. “It will interest you to know that Qatar investors are in several countries in Africa, but not in Nigeria. “Nigeria and Qatar jointly have stakes in the future of gas, as the debate is on as to the future of gas in the energy transition plans,” he said. Speaking on the benefits of the visit for MSMEs in Nigeria, Tuggar said the visit provides opportunities for the business community to further engage with their Qatar partners to explore a mutually beneficial relationship. Minister of Youth Development, Ibrahim, on his part, expressed high hopes for the Nigerian youth as the Ministry was able to mobilise youths to Qatar on the President’s instructions to engage with their business community for mutual benefits. “We are here with about 17 young entrepreneurs in our team to attend the Nigeria/ Qatar business summit and we are looking forward to securing cooperation in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing and oil and gas,” he said.

       "   'content': \"That Ondo State matters to President Bola Tinubu is an understatement, what will happen in the April primary of the party is what many are beginning to imagine, as the state remains the only one in Southwest of the country that the president does not have a firm grip of the local politics. Last week’s (Wednesday, February 28, 2024) condolence visit of President Tinubu to the late Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s family was not just significant, but also an indication of where the former governor of Lagos may be heading ahead of the state’s All Progressives Congress ((APC) gubernatorial primary scheduled to hold in April. Over 20 aspirants are said to be jostling for the party’s ticket. They include incumbent governor, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, immediate former Commissioner for Finance, Wale Akinterinwa, former Legal Adviser of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olusola Oke and Senator Jimoh Ibrahim, who represents Ondo South in the Senate. Others are former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Oladunni Odu; former member of the House of Representatives, Mayowa Akinfolarin; former member, who represented the State on the Governing Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Olugbenga Edema; retired Director of Finance at the Nigerian Defence Academy, Olumide Ohunyeye. Also angling for the governorship ticket are former Commissioner for the Environment in the state, Sola Ebisemi; the Executive Director (Engineering and Technical Services) at Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited, Ifeoluwa Oyedele; APC National Vice Chair (South-west), Isaac Kekemeke; former President of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Adedayo Faduyile; Paul Akintelure; Olusola Iji; Jimi Odimayo; Matthew Oyerinmade and Funmilayo Adekojo. Why Tinubu Is Seen As Man In The Centre The Guardian gathered that the intrigues in Ondo APC politics ahead of the April primary is because the President has been very interested in the state since 1999, but elections in Ondo have always not favoured him. When the defunct Alliance for Democracy (AD) split into two in 2003, the Ondo AD, under late Governor Adebayo Adefarati, didn’t follow the camp of Tinubu. The late governor went with Afenifere and the party’s national chairman, Mojisola Akinfenwa, who died in 2019. Tinubu also supported former governor of the state, Olusegun Mimiko in 2008, to reclaim his mandate from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) through the courts, hoping that Iroko, who contested and won under the platform of Labour Party (LP), would defect to Action Congress of Nigeria (CAN) from LP but Mimiko disappointed him and both parted ways. In 2012, when Mimiko was running for second term, Tinubu brought all the known political heavyweights in Ondo State into ACN to oust Mimiko but he also failed. Tinubu settled to anoint the late Akeredolu as the party’s candidate then in a manner that many considered controversial, which party members frowned at. The former President of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) eventually lost the election to Mimiko. In 2016, President Tinubu also expressed interest in the state’s politics by endorsing Mr. Segun Abraham as his choice aspirant to become the governor of Ondo but Akeredolu, who was also in the race then, but no longer in Tinubu’s camp, joined forces with the ‘Abuja group’, said to be directing events under the former President Muhammadu Buhari, to emerge the party’s candidate for Ondo APC in spite of Tinubu. Again, Tinubu failed in his bid to gain inroad to Ondo politics in 2016. ASnd from that year, till his eventual demise, the late Governor Akeredolu played Ondo politics without Tinubu’s impact. Little wonder he got a second term and remained governor until his death. The Guardian checks showed that with the demise of Akeredolu and the former governor of Lagos State now president, the political calculations may have changed. The implications of Akeredolu’s death is that the Southwest leaders of APC, like Tinubu, Chiefs Bisi Akande, Segun Osoba and others, who have been looking forward to getting the party’s structure in Ondo now have everything at their disposal to determine what happens in the state’s chapter of APC. Although the Wednesday visit was a condolence visit to Akeredolu’s family, it also showed a strong political signal that Tinubu has come to take charge of Ondo structure and politics and invariably the Southwest leadership of APC. Aiyeditawa It was learnt that President Tinubu may have seen in Aiyedatiwa somebody willing to help in fostering Asiwaju’s political hegemony in Ondo State. Political commentators point to one factor as helping Aiyeditawa to be someone to be trusted. They said it was Akeredolu that brought Aiyedatiwa into Ondo politics but when the cabal in Akeredolu’s cabinet allegedly led by Akinterinwa, had inkling of how serious the late governor’s illness was and that he may not survive, they circled around him, to ensure he did not act, as demanded by the Constitution.Their plan, however, failed. It was gathered that if not for the intervention of President Tinubu, the agenda to impeach Aiyedatiwa would have succeeded but the presidency deliberately stopped it. The cabal had successfully turned Akeredolu’s mind against the governor and he was ready to remove Aiyedatiwa just as he did to his former deputy, Agboola Ajayi, whom Akeredolu removed in 2020. All manner of efforts were made to frustrate Aiyedatiwa between September to December last year but it all failed until Akeredolu finally passed on December 27. It was said that the only way to stop Akeredolu’s political hegemony in Ondo is to use Aiyedatiwa, who is perceived to be neutral in the state’s politics and with no structure. Tinubu’s visit to Ondo goes beyond condolence. Recall that during the APC presidential primary in 2022, Akeredolu and his political structure did not support Tinubu. They supported the former Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. As at that time, Aiyedatiwa was helpless and had no say in who Akeredolu and his loyalists supported during the presidential primary. He was seen as a neutral person by Tinubu and the Southwest leaders of APC. Tinubu faced a lot of challenges during the presidential primary and he has been diplomatically dealing with those who antagonised him then. The presidency also sees Aiyedatiwa as someone who does not have any political background or inkling, who can be trusted to handle the political ideology of the former governor of Lagos, if entrusted with power. For instance, it may be difficult for the Tinubu to trust other governorship aspirants, especially Oke, Akinterinwa and Ibrahim. They believe that the majority of the aspirants have had their inputs in Ondo politics and may possibly want to assert themselves contrary to the ideology of Tinubu if supported into power. Oke He is said to have a PDP background, which the Southwest APC leaders may not be comfortable with. He has also contested twice for Ondo gubernatorial race on different platforms. Akinterinwa Akinterinwa used to be one of the ardent followers of Tinubu before; his problem with the President may have started when he served under Mimiko as Finance Commissioner. He eventually left Mimiko’s government in 2008. Ibrahim Senator Ibrahim is considered to be an outsider in APC, who is assumed to be carrying his luck very far after he got the party’s senatorial ticket on a platter of gold. He is also said to be too independent minded to be given political leadership without much struggle. He recently opposed Tinubu’s choice of Senate president by supporting another candidate during the election of the leadership of Senate. Others The role played by some of the aspirants in 2016 against Segun Abraham, who happens to be the choice candidate of Tinubu for the gubernatorial primary of APC in Ondo is still hunting them. For instance, some of them colluded with the then Buhari led presidency to undermine the former governor of Lagos State, while others aligned with a former governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, to contest the 2016 gubernatorial poll in Ondo on the platform of another party. The Guardian learnt that a particular aspirant, who considered himself financially stronger and also close to Tinubu allegedly spent over two weeks recently in Abuja to see the president but he deliberately ignored him because of the role such aspirant had played in the past. It is, therefore, glaring that what Tinubu did during his visit to Ondo and how he tactically cut off other governorship aspirants, was an indication of his body language as to where he is going. The camaraderie between Tinubu and Aiyedatiwa during the visit also indicated the possible direction the presidency may go in April at the primary. Another indication of where Tinubu may likely go was the interaction between him and Bola Ilori, one of the political protégées of Aregbesola at Ondo airport. On alighting from the plane in Ondo, Tinubu was said to have asked Ilori, “where do you belong? And Ilori responded, pointing to Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa, this is where I belong sir. Then Tinubu responded with a smile, “Lucky will bring you to see me.” The inability of other aspirants to enter the tarmac to welcome Tinubu to Ondo was also another signal of who the president may possibly support in the coming primary. It is also interesting that if Mr. President had really wanted a level playing ground, he would have met with all the aspirants either at the party’s Secretariat in Ondo or elsewhere to encourage them but he didn’t do that. It is clear that Tinubu will never visit any state in such a circumstance without necessarily playing the politics of that state. Political observers also read meaning to the way Tinubu thanked Aiyedatiwa for giving his former boss (Akeredolu) a befitting burial, which was probably a nod for the incumbent to continue. Recall that Betty Anyanwu, the wife of Akeredolu, specifically thanked Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for the role the Lagos State governor played in bringing back the body of her husband to Nigeria, a role Sanwo-Olu wouldn’t have played without a nod from Abuja to assist Aiyedatiwa for the successful burial of his boss. Also significant to note is the role the leader of Yoruba socio-cultural body, Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti played during the scheming to impeach Aiyedatiwa. The nonagenarian personally wrote to President Tinubu to wade into the matter, which perhaps prompted Tinubu’s intervention in the imbroglio as at then. That may have warranted Tinubu’s visit to Pa Fasoranti during the visit to Ondo, where the other aspirants were deliberately shut out. Also fascinating was the recent visit of the Iyaloja General of Nigeria, Mrs Folashade Tinubu- Ojo, the daughter of Tinubu, to Governor Aiyedatiwa, which was tantamount to endorsing the incumbent. It was also discovered that the Southwest governors of APC are solidly supporting Aiyedatiwa, whom they perceived as a cool headed person and a loyal party member. If indeed the current equation did not change between now and April, Aiyedatiwa stands a good chance of winning the ticket and with a possible opportunity of retaining power in November.

       "   'content': \"The immediate past governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, handed over power to his successor, Alhaji Ahmed Usman Ododo, on January 27, 2024 after spending eight years at the popular Lugard House, Lokoja. No doubt, the governor has made an indelible footprint in the state which serves as colonial administrative headquarters in the early 90s. Bello was sworn into office in January.2016 after the rerun election he won following the demise of Prince Abubakar Audu, who passed on hours before the 2015 governorship election were concluded in the state. Our correspondent, IBRAHIM OBANSA, writes on the eight year tenure of Yahaya Bello. The Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, on Saturday, January 27, 2024, transmitted power to the winner of the November 11, 2023, governorship election in Kogi State, Alhaji Ahmed Usman Ododo of the All Progressives Congress (APC). No doubt, the eight years tenure of Governor Yahaya Bello will go in history as the most litigated administration in the history of the state. Bello, who came second in the 2015 primary election of the APC, replaced Prince Abubakar Audu, who died hours to his victory. Bello contested the 2019 Governorship election, which he won overwhelmingly, but not without a challenge by his closest rival, Idris Wada, who came second in the election. In the two contests, the Apex court in the land upheld Bello’s election. However, assessing the modest achievements of the governor, stakeholders were quick to say that the new helmsman must sustain his predecessor’s giant stride in the provision of critical infrastructures to the benefit of citizens Only recently, the Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE), on tour of projects executed by the former governor, advised the new Governor of the State, Alhaji Ahmed Usman Ododo, to sustain the giant stride of his predecessor Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello, in the provision of critical infrastructures. The President of NGE, Mr Eze Anaba, gave the advice while briefing journalists, shortly after the media tour of the Reference Hospital and other legacy projects of the former governor. Anaba, who noted that the immediate past administration has left a legacy worthy of emulation, said the good work of former Governor Bello should be sustained by the present administration. While noting that Kogi State is working, the NGE President disclosed that the current administration under Ododo would be doing people of the state good by sustaining the legacies of his former boss. Continuing, Anaba said: “Democracy is about the people and the facilities we have seen, the road construction we saw and the traffic time they have saved people of Kogi State and Nigeria in general that alone will help the country, boost our economy and help the citizens. People waste and lose life on traffic. If the road network is strong like we saw, I’m sure Nigeria will be better for it. “Government is a continuum. I will advise the current Government to follow the foot step of his predecessor. It is only in that way the citizens will benefit and Kogi State will become the best place in the country. People will know that democracy has taken root in Kogi and the people are benefitting. “At the end of the day, governance is about the people. From what I have seen, from what my colleagues saw, Kogi is working in terms of, education infrastructure and medical care.” Earlier, while taking journalists round the hospital, the Chief Medical Director of Reference Hospital, Okene, Prof Solomon Avidime, said the facility has state of the art equipment to attend to the medical needs of Nigerians. “You can’t find some of the equipments we are having here in other parts of the country. Outside this place, we have a centre that has a CT scan and MRI. They are all latest equipment. We have oxygen plant where we produced medical oxygen meant to serve not just Kogi, but the entire North Central as well as Nigeria.” He noted that the hospital has an updated highly equipped radiology department. “The MRI we have here is the latest with artificial intelligence that has a processing time of about 30 minutes with our patients,” the CMD added. The Kogi State Commissioner for Health, Dr Abdlulazeez Adams Adeiza, on his part, noted the edifice is not just out to serve the people of Kogi State, but the entire Nigerian nation. Another member of the Guild, Adebayo Bodunrin, commended Kogi State government over its commitment to the educational development through upliftment of existing institutions and establishment of new ones. Bodunrin, who was speaking after the inspection of the GYB Model Science Secondary School, Adankolo, poured encomiums on the state government for the feat attained in educational advancement of the state. “For me, I believe in education. And I believe that is where the future of the country is. When we have educated people, we will be able to have knowledge to solve our problems. “This is a bold initiative. I’m happy that they said they are four across the state. I do hope that in future that each local government will be able to have structures of this nature. “And we will be at the forefront of producing future scientists, technologists, that will help our country to less its dependence on other nations,” he said. Briefing newsmen at the Ganaja Junction Flyover, the state Commissioner for Works, Mohammed Yusuf, said the project was part of the GYB Legacy Projects. The Commissioner, who was represented by Akubo Alhassan, Deputy Director, Civil Engineering, Ministry of Works, said, “this project was conceived and fully funded by the immediate past Government of Alhaji Yahaya Bello. “The necessity of this project is that when you pass here before now, it was characterised by gridlocks at peak hours of 7.00am to 9.00am and 4.00pm to 7.00pm. “We have occasions of patients dying in the gridlock on their way to hospitals, but the immediate past governor, in his wisdom, decided to resolve this conflict and gridlock permanently. “When you come here now, the issue of gridlock has been resolved, there is free flow of traffic and it may interest you to know that this is the first ever flyover in Kogi State.” He said that apart from the flyover, government also overlaid the dual carriage way from the Flyover to Zenith Bank Junction. He added that though a Federal road, His Excellency intervened in overlaying the road from the Ganaja Bridge through Dunamis Church to the flyover. The commissioner said the state government had done five other township roads, especially from GYB Model Science Secondary School to Zenith Bank Junction, Dunamis through Federal University. “There is another from Sardauna Junction through Maigari Palace. That is our escape route in the event of flood. Then Adankolo UBA to Adankolo Estate: Just this one, Government House Junction to the flyover. It is part of the facelift Bello has given to the state headquarters. “Phase two, phase one, phase three road construction are ongoing. Some have been completed and some are at various stages of completion. “As we go to Osara, you will see Zone 8 roundabout through CBN to Crusher. It is ongoing. Zone 8 roundabout through the Chari-Maigumeri Barrack to Zango to GYB Junction. Works are ongoing there simultaneously.” Governor Bello will also go into history as one governor who established two universities within a record time of four years. The first is the Confluence University of Science and Technology, Osara and the Kogi State University, Kabba. A chieftain of APC, and ex speaker, Kogi State House of Assembly, Abdullahi Bello, said this was unprecedented in the history of the state. He noted that the former governor was able to maintain and sustained an uninterrupted academic calendar in all the state’s tatiary institutions across the state. Other legacy projects executed by the immediate administration include the rice mill in Omi, the ultra modern Buhari Civic Centre in the heart of Lokoja, the Kogi State capital. The new Governor, Alhaji Ahmed Usman Ododo, during his inaugural speech, said he would continue to build on the achievements of his predecessor in the areas of infrastructure, security effective healthcare delivery among other legacies of the governor Bello administration. Speaking at the maiden matriculation of the Kogi State University, Kabba, Bello said with official opening and maiden matriculation of Kogi State University, Kabba, “my vision for the establishment of a University in Kabba had been fulfilled.” The governor said he met a state that was in a deplorable situation, but expressed gratitude to God that he would be handing over the state better than he met it. “Today I’m fulfilled. I promised to be part of the ceremony for the first set of matriculating students. I feel fulfilled and satisfied that we achieved our dreams.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"Ogun State government is set to train 100,000 Small Medium Scale Enterprises (SMSEs), especially youths, on emerging technologies, towards attaining the peak in digital economy. This would be done through GetFundedAfrica Technologies (GFAT) in partnership with Microsoft, Google and Meta.Delivering a keynote address during the launch of the training at OgunTechHub, Abeokuta, tagged, “Gateway Skills Programme”, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Cyber Security, Senator Shuaib Salisu, said the empowerment would be an opportunity for SMSEs and youths who want to be self-reliant, get equipped with relevant technology skills enabling them upgrade to digital marketing. Salisu, who expressed optimism that the programme would revive the economic situation in Nigeria, said the state has the potentials to drive the programme in achieving desired goal. Also speaking, Special Adviser on ICT, Mr. Dayo Abiodun, said the partnership with Microsoft, Google and others was a deliberate attempt by the state government to expose small business owners, as well as young graduates to hidden benefits of digital economy, calling on beneficiaries to get registered, trained, certified and start working immediately, among other opportunities. The Co-founder, GFAT, Mr. Adebowale Omololu, explained that the programme was designed for SMSEs and young graduates in Ogun, to be the first beneficiaries before other states, giving them necessary support to develop carriers in ICT, access finance and mentorship to grow their businesses, noting that digital economy is a pathway for thriving entrepreneurship. He said: ‘’We chose Ogun State first among others because of the business-friendly atmosphere created by Prince Dapo Abiodun. So, a portal will be opened for interested SMSEs to register; we will take them through different training sessions, upscale their products and services to a tech community and help them to access grants from international and local partners. “Also, job seekers will have direct or indirect opportunities, thereby promoting digital marketing that will in the long run, boost revenue and position Ogun State on high pedestal.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'description': 'Stakeholders in the agricultural sector have expressed different views over the Federal Government’s plan to reintroduce the Commodity Board, to regulate soaring prices of food in the country. The post Building consensus around FG’s proposed commodity board initiative appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Stakeholders in the agricultural sector have expressed different views over the Federal Government’s plan to reintroduce the Commodity Board, to regulate soaring prices of food in the country. Recall that last month; the Vice President Kashim Shettima, at a two-day high-level strategic meeting on climate change, food systems and resource mobilisation in Abuja, announced that the board would be given the mandate to assess and regulate food prices, as well as maintain a strategic food reserve for stabilising prices of crucial grains and other food items. “Our solution to the potential food crisis has become immediate, medium, and long-term strategies…and addressing price volatility by establishing a national commodity board. This board will continually assess and regulate food prices, maintaining a strategic food reserve for stabilising prices of crucial grains and other food items,” the vice president said. But while some see this as a welcome development, others say there are no concrete frameworks that would make it work, as it failed in the past. The Chief Executive Officer, Green Sahara Farms, Plateau State, Suleiman Dikwa, said the envisaged commodity board “is a repeat of the mistake we make in most of our policies, picking solutions wholesale and implementing them without taking cognisance of our environmental context.” While noting that commodity boards are based on social and economic structures that drive the market, Dikwa said there is a fundamental flaw in the objectives of the proposed board, “we are no longer in the 1970s and 1980s when the Federal Government has capacity and intent to run the boards, which were any way abandoned due to corruption among other issues. “The proposed commodity board has the potential to bring stability to food prices by continually assessing and regulating them. This could alleviate the burden on consumers and enhance overall economic predictability and the creation of a strategic food reserve for stabilising prices of commodities, basically a regulator. “Let’s compare with Indian commodity board, the Indian take cognisance of their social and cultural context, including the large geography and people to deal with set up boards to play from production market enabling control and their choice is clear by focusing on particular crops, while Nigeria, with its desperate geography, population, and weak institutions, seeks to regulate chaos and control prices without input or key holding in the process to effect price control.” He said the structure of the commodity economy right now starts with the farmer harvesting and selling to nearby markets, keeping their stock to eat and sell in the event of ill health or weddings or deaths. “From the local market, it moves to the main market in the zone and to Kano or Lagos and exports, so how do you control the prices? Same scenarios play out in Thailand – the most successful smallholder farmer system in the world. Government’s intervention should be the buyers first, to protect the farmer and in the context the farmer operates.” Dikwa posited that there is enough food in the country currently, noting that, “what we have is an organised hysteria to develop a racket to fleece Nigeria. “By now, we should recognise the patterns in our agro industry; every government takes a story and the so called associations of one crop or the other push for interventions using the associations and conniving or deceiving government of the day who releases funds to these political farmers. Here we are, the evidence is clear, we have not been able to solve the key aspects of food security – affordability and nutrition. “We have enough food, but no enough money to buy it.” On his part, the Managing Director of BAMA Farms, Lagos, Prince Wale Oyekoya, said, the national commodity board will control commodities’ prices to meet the international standard just like the country’s crude oil prices. He said with the board, the country will continuously assess food prices, as well as maintain a strategic food reserve that will be used as a price stabilisation mechanism for critical grains and other food items, which would tackle irregularities in prices of agricultural produce. “It’s a welcome idea, as it will address all the matters pertaining to food, water availability and affordability, but the president have to be careful so that the cabals does not hijack the policy and mess it up just like what played out during President Buhari’s regime. “Also, the money saved from the fuel subsidy should be invested in the agricultural sector to improve the food production in the country such as – provision of land with title to the real farmers; mechanisation of the sector to attract youths; provision of security for the farmers and in all the aspects of value chain in the sector; and provision of storage facilities to curb spoilage and post-harvest loss among others.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"To not speak ill of the dead is not just a moral obligation but also, even more importantly, a simple, even logical, social demand. And I am not, as yet, talking about the obvious portrayal of the one speaking ill of the dead as cowardly. It is, to begin with, a simple commonsense thing: or can one exult, without censure, in one’s victory in a boxing match in which the opponent’s hands were tied to the back all through? No, right? Now, that is the point, namely, that no one is going to deliver a bouquet of Damascus Rose (Rosa damascene) to the one who takes the floor to shout the most obscenities at the dead who cannot defend himself. Because such a person would only be wasting his or her time and, certainly, that of the rest of us! In effect, George was questioning the concept of small beginnings, or the rags-to-riches stories of many of Nigeria’s persons of means. The late MKO Abiola hawked stuffs on the streets to make a living; Glo owner Chief Mike Adenuga reportedly drove taxi in America to make ends meet; oil magnate, Mrs. FolorunshoAlakija started life as a seamstress; Innoson took off as a spare-parts dealer; Elizade started as a ‘shop-floor’ Toyota sales executive, etc. So, whether it’s Aig-Imoukuede, Herbert Wigwe, Tony Elumelu or the Oando boys, the small-beginning success stories of Nigeria’s better known business whizz-aren’t narratives to be scoffed at by any snorty elder, because these are stories many of us can relate to. And so, to use Wigwe’s sad demise as a launch-pad for scurrilous attacks on the nation’s nouveau riche – on their persons, business careers and ethics – is not only morbidly distasteful but also cowardly mischievous and callously libelous. Just what was Chief George’s point? A call on the regulatory authorities to go after Access bank now that Wigwe is dead? I don’t get it. It is for that same reason – inappropriateness of the timing and its lack of substantiality – that I consider as disingenuous the argument by MuizBanire, a Lagos lawyer and political activist, that, in relation to mergers and acquisitions in the Nigerian banking sector, it couldn’t have been possible for ‘the tilapia to swallow the whale’ but for some underhand dealings. He was referring to the acquisition of the former Intercontinental Bank by the Access Bank in 2012. Instructively, Banire’s article, coming 12 years after the Access –Intercontinental deal, was also sparked by Wigwe’s passing. Didn’t Banire have this to say while Wigwe was alive? Or he didn’t have the courage to say it, knowing that he was trading in drivel? Taken in its real context, Banire couldn’t but have intended his article as an epitaph of shame on Wigwe’s memory for his and his Access co-investor, Aig-Imoukuede’s dare to acquire the then Intercontinental bank, an object of cultural pride.

The post Consult widely on issues of governance, Lukman advises Tinubu appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Former Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Malam Salihu Lukman has called on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to stop behaving like a philosopher king over issues of governance of the country. Lukman in a piece yesterday titled, ‘Beyond Taking Responsibility’, accused President Tinubu of unilaterally taking decisions without the input of organs of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The immediate past national vice chairman North West of the APC cited the issue of removal of subsidy on petroleum products, floating the exchange rate of the naira, sanction against Niger Republic following the coup of July 26, 2023 and the implementation of the Steve Oronsaye report as decisions unilaterally taken by Tinubu without the input of the party. Lukman claimed that under President Tinubu, issues of inclusivity are now in reverse gear as Nigerians are told to take every decision made by the government even when faced with grave consequences. The Kaduna-born politician argued that the development runs contrary to the progressive ideal of the APC. He noted: “Without any hesitation, one can argue that at the rate we are going, our party, APC, and our leaders have shortchanged Nigerians. What Nigerians are having today wasn’t what was promised at all. The most disturbing reality is that given that the current economic hardship is produced during the first term of President Asiwaju Tinubu, with no end in sight; does it then mean that President Asiwaju Tinubu is not interested in second term? Certainly not! “If he is interested in a second term, why is he managing the affairs of government like a military dictator, shutting down the structures of the party and talking down on citizens like a philosopher king who has absolute knowledge of what will produce possible happiness for citizens? “Unless the objective is to secure a second term by other means and not the votes of electorate, there cannot be any logical reasoning. Could that be the reason for the new found love with some identified political mercenaries who were strongly opposed to the election of President Asiwaju Tinubu? “How successful could they be? If military governments with all their recruited mercenaries could fail to guarantee their survival, how could anyone imagine that mercenaries could win a second term for President Asiwaju? It is so painful that party members have been denied access to meeting President Asiwaju Tinubu but some shylock political mercenaries have now become the faces and promoters of our so-called progressive government. “Where are our founding leaders who negotiated the formation of the APC? What exactly do our founding leaders want to leave behind as their political legacy? Is it that they have also resigned and accepted that the whole APC project is limited to making it possible for former President Buhari and President Asiwaju Tinubu to become President? “In that case, why should Nigerians trust any political leader in future when they come with proposals for mergers or even political alliances? Certainly, once leaders cannot function within structures of political parties, such that leaders only operate based on omnipotent status, no matter how loosely defined, commitment of leaders to democratic development of Nigeria will be weak. “As it is, the commitment of President Asiwaju to democratic development of Nigeria is increasingly being withdrawn. And so long as he continues to manage his government without allowing structures of the APC to operate and through that contribute to the decisions of government, President Asiwaju Tinubu, just like former President Buhari’s government, will risk being on the path of continuous betrayal of expectations of Nigerians. Worst still, being a government that detests inclusivity, it will be anything but progressive.” Lukman expressed hope that President Tinubu would recover his democratic credentials and reactivate his progressive politics before it is too late. He stressed that as long as he continues to operate a closed government in which party leaders and members are unable to access him, he would continue to miss the golden opportunity God has given him to put Nigeria on the path of sustained democratic development. “No amount of mercenary propaganda will change that. May Allah (SWT) give him and all our leaders the necessary guide to return to the path of democratic and progressive politics. Amin!” he prayed. You must be logged in to post a comment.

It is a serene neighbourhood, but the serenity residents of the estate have enjoyed for over two decades, according to some concerned inhabitants, is about to be disrupted, if the unregulated plans by officials of the estate’s management to erect an illegal structure on a small piece of land that has been used over the years as meeting venue, among others, is not curbed. Speaking on the development, Alhaji Olusoga Elias Olowolekomoh, the Oba-elect of Odo-Nla Kingdom, Ikorodu, Lagos, a pioneer home owner in MKO Abiola Gardens since 1997, was apprehensive about the illegal structure, especially as it is right by his building entrance gate. “I am one of the first set of resident landlords domiciled in MKO Gardens, Alausa, Ikeja since 1997. Though based in England, United Kingdom, I do visit friends and relatives back home at periodic intervals as deemed necessary. I am a native of Ikorodu, Lagos State, Nigeria,” the businessman and philanthropist said. “On a small portion of land inside MKO Gardens that used to be known to the entire estate and outsiders as ‘wood office’ next to my property, which later turned to out to become centre of divergent businesses was converted to wooden shanties and eventually a make-shift small block used often as meetings venue by the estate management officials after the original landlords; Lagos State Development and Property Corporation (LSDPC) left the estate premises for quite some time now. “As a matter of fact, the estate meeting centre later caved with the building structures partially collapsed to the ground. Afterwards, information and intelligence received from credible sources indicated that series of geological tests were commissioned and conducted to ascertain the integrity of the soil’s solidity and conditions. The verdict was a certified declaration that no tangible and enduring structure or property can be erected at the site for health and safety reasons, being a left over portion of landscape segregated as access point area. It is also a point for identifying and monitoring underground sewage waste channels and pipelines for the entire estate with connection points to major sewage canal extensions outside the community as far as main drainage connected to Alausa districts and other adjoining communities beyond the axis.” Olowolekomoh’s main concern is the current estate management’s penchant for”indiscriminate erection of dangerous structures and dumping of recyclable waste products and toxic materials on the site in flagrant abuse and violations of communal environmental sanitation laws and regulations by state and non-state actors for personal gratification benefits and purposes.” He disclosed that the estate’s new executive members who visited the site did nothing; rather they diverted discussions to other irrelevant issues despite the severity of the matter at stake. Olowolekomoh also said a lady, who is equally one of the management staff, did not respond to several attempts to reach her on the phone concerning the matter. “Currently, the unrelenting abuse extends to direct trespassing and encroachment against my property that is situated next door with a concrete fence and floral demarcations to the open landscape. My building’s frontage and adjacent wall fence have become so blighted and damaged with varied physical defacement that has cost me significant amount to restore and repair at separate intervals. “Aside from the above personal burdens, the unregulated use of this landscape poses great existential dangers and risks to the overall communal environmental sanitation and which designates the ground as a green space for ecosystem balancing and aesthetics in perfect alignments with the Lagos State Ministry of Urban and Town Planning regulations.” To his surprise, however, while he was pushing to ensure that the telecommunication company’s high mast on the land was dismantled and removed, “it got to my notice that the same small portion of land has been sold to someone who has now demolished the old cracked meetings centre, with an intent to build residential/commercial property on the land atop the underground sewage units despite expert’s warnings and advice to this effect. “The very high telecom mast and electronic billboard on the land positioned next to my property’s wall to the extent that parts of the support braces are laying on my concrete flower pots while posterior wall fence is encroached from the side adjacent to my gate entrance. “My urgent appeal to the Ministry of Urban and Town Planning, LSPDC and Lagos State government, therefore, is to take immediate action to secure the ground in reference with a view to restore and conserve it as an ultra communal green space it was designated for against any prohibited residential or commercial developments hazardous to environmental safety. “As a matter of fact, verified investigation reports by expert consultants indicated that installation of high telecom mast on the site failed the relevant Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports while ongoing developments on the land also constitute infringements on the integrity of surrounding properties within its immediate vicinity. “What may have given the estate authorities the temerity to attempt to block the entrance of his second gate may be because they thought there was no government approval for it. “What they don’t know is that as far back as November 2007, I already got the approval from the Lagos State Development and Property Corporation. I paid the required fee and I am good. Now, they think they can encroach into my property, block my entrance with an illegal structure and destroy my flower pots.A viable regeneration plan can optimize a better use of the space as a recreation ground with carefully designed landscape beautification and facilities that provides strategic added aesthetic communal value to the estate in particular while also being of immense benefits to the public at large,”he said. Olowolekomoh, who commended the estate management authority in the areas of security and organisation, however, maintained that in the event of no positive proactive action by the authority to secure the ground against the nuisance and gross abuse taking place at the site, he as a concerned homeowner may be left with no other alternative “than to pursue legal actions to safeguard and protect the integrity of his property. This, he said, is to secure the site against threats of hazardous urban property developers and opportunists desperate to sabotage and compromise the safety of the estate’s residents including members of the general public against looming environmental disasters due to their compromised perversions bordering on personal selfish aggrandizement at the expense of all and sundry. “The estate management should be commended on the way and manner it has secured residents. The security organisation is top notch and the environment very neat, befitting the status of the estate. The only black spot is the proposed erection of that illegal structure which I am contesting,” he submitted. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"Bimbo Oloyede ‘Research Should Be Continuous If Solutions Must Be Found For Cancer’ Bimbo Oloyede has the reputation of being the first woman to cast Network News on Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). She is an author, speaker and trainer, and has been a broadcast professional for nearly five decades. She was employed by the then National Broadcasting Company Television (NBC) TV as an assistant producer in 1975, and was later assigned to the Presentation Department. She became a pioneer member of the NTA’s Network News team and thus, the first woman to cast Network News on television. Thereafter, she teamed up with her husband and became an independent Radio/TV producer, presenter, moderator and compere. She established The Women’s Optimum Development Foundation (WODEF) and from 2000 to 2015, partnered with UNFPA, UN Women, UNIC, USAID, UNDP, the Canadian Government, the British Council and others, convening workshops, producing radio jingles, radio and TV drama, promoting gender equality and highlighting gender-based violence. She was also elected National Coordinator of The Global Fund for Women Network in Nigeria, which she headed for over five years. From 2002 to 2015, she was a consultant/news anchor and trainer at Channels Television and was honoured with a lifetime achievement award for journalistic excellence by the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism, in 2015. Over the years, Bimbo has anchored hundreds of news bulletins and presented/moderated scores of live and recorded TV shows for the public and private sector at state, national and international events. Currently, Bimbo is the CEO/Lead Consultant at Strictly Speaking and for the last 25 years, she has trained and coached various clients in elocution, public speaking and communication skills. In 2016, she published STRICTLY SPEAKING: Pronunciation Made Easy and STRICTLY SPEAKING: An Oral Guide for Schools and Colleges, followed in 2018. The publications have been approved by the N.E.R.D.C and state Ministries of Education, for use in senior secondary schools. In this interview with MARIA DIAMOND, she spoke about her plans to celebrate her 70th birth on 15th March to raise N100million for cancer research and treatment in public hospitals, as well as the place of women the leadership of Nigeria. As the first woman to cast Network News on NTA, tell us about this milestone and how it shaped your career – What it meant then for you as a woman and what it still means. There is no doubt that being a female newscaster as far back as 1976 has had a tremendous impact on my life and career. Since it was an instruction that came out of the blue, something that I did not plan for, I could never have imagined what the effect would be. First, I was redeployed from the Drama Department, where I was an assistant producer, to the Presentation Department, with Chief Julie Coker, as my HOD. Finally, when our roles became defined, I was transferred to the Newsroom. With that much exposure, I began to receive invitations to compere live events, which enabled me to meet a variety of notable and interesting personalities from the private and public sectors. This part of my career continued long after I had left the NTA and dovetailed into training those who were interested in improving their presentation and public speaking skills. Live presentations picked up again when I joined Channels TV many years later as a part-time News Anchor, leading to invitations to make virtual or live keynote presentations at conferences, summits etc. You can see that all the offshoots had their genesis in my role as a newscaster back in the day. As a young woman in broadcast journalism, it was an exciting time being part of something new and partnering with renowned male broadcasters who had carved names for themselves as radio news presenters. Mike Enahoro, Bode Alalade, Ikenna Ndaguba; all of whom became titled chiefs were our partners in the early days but unfortunately, they are also all of blessed memory. They were all my seniors in age and experience and I relied on them for guidance. Of course, these days, all the stations are populated with female broadcast journalists and I am always pleased to interact with them and engage them, especially as a trainer. My past experiences come in handy when discussing with them and our unique positions as female goldfish that has no hiding place are often tabled. Since I have been there, we are able to rub minds about professionalism and balancing the work/life equation. What was your most exciting experience while in NTA? I think probably one of the most exciting times was during FESTAC 77. The Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON) assembled broadcasters from all over the country and a studio was set up within the National Theatre. We broadcast live bulletins thrice daily for one month and we were also deployed to various venues to host the events as they occurred. For a young broadcaster like me, it was a really exciting time as Nigeria hosted artistes from all over the world and I was chosen to open the TV coverage of the festival broadcasts. It was a big deal to me, an unforgettable opportunity. You are right. We cannot close the care gap. We can only try to reduce the gap and we know that N100 million is probably just a drop in the ocean. However, it is a starting point and I believe that with the cooperation of health care practitioners employed in public hospitals, the quality of service will be improved. So as we grow, the government should see us as partners working towards the same goal. Aside from cancer, maternal death is another challenge in Nigeria. How do you think we can minimise mortality rate? Maternal mortality is another daunting challenge. Ignorance is often responsible for avoidable deaths. This is a health issue that should be top priority for every local government chairman. The primary health centres should be partnering with the National Orientation Agency officers in each of the 774 local government offices, to ensure that information is shared regularly about basic health practices for women in local languages. Traditional birth attendants, who many local women consult, should be officially listed (if they are not) so that they establish links with medical personnel who can intervene when it is necessary. Emergencies are often not catered for but plans should be in place to forestall tragedy when these emergencies occur. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"The National Assembly’s fresh proposal for an increase in the budget of the Special Intervention Projects (SIP), popularly known as the Constituency Projects, is uncalled for and undeserving of a positive consideration. The Constituency Projects, with a current yearly budget of N100 billion per year, is a phenomenon that has been afflicted more with sleaze than honesty, besides being an aberration that legislators are seeking to legitimize. Considering the financial irregularities that have been evidently associated with the projects over the past years, the programme should have no place in the scheme of the country’s democracy and should therefore be discontinued. Last year, the Senate threw out a Bill seeking to legalize Constituency Projects by including it in the annual National Budget. However, the fresh bid to include the Constituency Projects in the National Budget has resurfaced under the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio. The National Assembly proposes that 20 percent of the National Budget should be appropriated for Constituency Projects allowance. If this proposal scales through, a gargantuan 20 per cent of the National Budget would be appropriated for the so-called Constituency Projects. Some Senators have criticized the current N100 billion constituency projects as static and insufficient to carry out meaningful constituency projects within today’s economic realities. It is hardly surprising that the proposal has been eliciting widespread public outrage and condemnation. The various stakeholders and the general public maintain that the Constituency Projects budget is illegal and unconstitutional. We join the stakeholders and the general public in unequivocally condemning the proposal. Further, the Constituency Projects scheme should be completely scrapped. The Constituency Projects are just conduit pipes for siphoning off the national treasury. The idea of the Constituency Projects was conceived in 1999 during the tenure of President Olusegun Obasanjo. At that time, people believed that such a venture would yield a direct impact on the lives of the people, especially those in rural communities, following arguments that it would bring governance closer to them. Conversely, there was another school of thought that kicked against a situation in which members of the National Assembly would directly determine what projects come to their constituency in addition to influencing the would-be contractors. Consequently, an agreement was reached among the parties concerned, paving the way for an annual practice whereby the Federal Government set aside a considerably huge amount of money for the implementation of the projects through the Office of the Special Adviser to the President on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in agreement with the lawmakers. These projects, which are developmental and meant for the grassroots, are often introduced by lawmakers for implementation in their constituencies. Unfortunately, since the inception of the Constituency Projects, there have been numerous reports of mismanagement and corruption associated with them. Funds meant for these projects often do not reach the intended beneficiaries, are misappropriated, or are diverted into the private pockets of politicians for their personal gain. For instance, it is on record that from 2003 to date, a staggering sum of N2 trillion has been spent on Constituency Projects, but there is little to show for this amount in the various constituency projects across the country. Besides, the selection of the projects is often based on political considerations rather than actual development needs, leading to a distortion of development priorities. The Constituency Projects funds are not subjected to any auditing. No sooner are the constituency projects started than they are abandoned, with no tracking of the projects either. Only last year, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) uncovered National Assembly members’ uncompleted constituency projects worth over N45 billion. There is often a lack of accountability in the implementation of constituency projects, making it difficult to track progress and ensure that funds are used appropriately. It is no wonder former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who started the venture, has described it as nothing but corruption. In his own words: “You and I know what constituency projects mean. It is simply corruption.” Similarly, former President Muhammadu Buhari stated in 2019 that the impact of the trillions of Naira spent on Constituency Projects could hardly be seen in the lives and welfare of ordinary Nigerians. Even some serving Senators in the National Assembly have decried Constituency Projects as an avenue for theft and corruption. More importantly, the National Assembly is constitutionally empowered to make laws for the country and to act as checks and balances on the Executive, not to execute constituency projects. It is not the business of the legislature to execute projects. The end does not justify the means. The fact that a few lawmakers have successfully carried out some constituency projects in their respective constituencies does not make constituency projects right. To rephrase the words of former President Goodluck Jonathan, don’t put the goat where the yam is because the goat will eat the yam. In the same vein, don’t allocate money for constituency projects to lawmakers because they will divert the money into their private pockets for personal gain. Instead of demanding constituency project funds to corruptly enrich themselves, Nigerian lawmakers can focus on several key areas to improve governance and benefit their constituents. For instance, they should ensure effective oversight of the executive branch to prevent corruption and ensure efficient use of public funds. They should also develop and pass laws that address pressing national issues such as security, education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. Additionally, they should engage with their constituents to understand their needs and concerns and advocate for policies that benefit them. Lawmakers should support anti-corruption efforts and advocate for transparency and accountability in government. Rather than advocate for an increase in Constituency Project funds, federal legislators should advocate for improved healthcare services, infrastructure, and access to education for all citizens. They should also advocate for policies that improve the quality of education, increase access to education, and address the challenges facing the education sector. Considering that Constituency Projects are engines of fraud and corruption and are not always aligned with the actual needs of constituents, we call for the complete scrapping of the Constituency Projects allowance. The National Assembly should address local development needs and community needs by strengthening local government structures, improving budget transparency and oversight mechanisms, and promoting community-driven development initiatives.

       "   'content': \"The Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Tunji Alausa, has said that the Federal Government would prioritise the training and development of medical super-specialists across various disciplines in the country. He said that the government would also address the infrastructural issues of the National Post-graduate Medical College of Nigeria (NPMCN) and the creation of well-equipped simulation centres. He pledged continued support for initiatives that would bridge the gap between education and healthcare in the country. Speaking, yesterday, at the investiture of Dr. Peter Ndidi Ebeigbe, as the 23rd President of the NPMCN, the minister said the landscape of healthcare was evolving rapidly, and with it, “the demand for specialised medical care is on the increase.” He said the population’s health needs were becoming increasingly complex, necessitating a cadre of highly- skilled specialists, who could address these challenges with proficiency and precision. The minister said to meet these demands, “it is imperative that the country should prioritise the training and development of medical super-specialists across various disciplines.” “By investing in advanced training programs and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation, we can ensure that our healthcare system remains at the forefront of medical excellence,” he said. Alausa stressed the need for research,saying to expand the pool of specialists, Nigeria must also harness and leverage on the power of technology. “Additionally, we must tap into the wealth of expertise within the Nigerian specialists in diaspora. Many talented medical professionals from Nigeria have excelled in their respective fields abroad, and their knowledge and experience are invaluable assets to our healthcare system,” he said. Ebeigbe, in his inaugural address, focused on the impact of brain drain on the country, warning that economic interventions are urgently needed to stem it and prevent a collapse of the health system. He revealed that the number of candidates registering for their examinations has crashed due to the exodus of many resident doctors to other countries. Ebeigbe urged the Federal Government to urgently intervene with deliberate measures that would keep the necessary personnel back home so that the massive investment of resources would not end up being a waste.

       "   'content': \"As a crucial step towards nation-building, African countries have been urged to reaffirm their commitment towards women empowerment.A former, Rector, Yaba College of Technology, Obafemi Omokungbe, made this appeal in his keynote speech at the African Women Foundation for Nation Building’s (WINBAFRICA) 10th anniversary celebration, which was held at the Alliance Francaise, Mike Adenuga Centre, Ikoyi, Lagos. As a Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers, Omokungbe, matched his lobbying efforts with WINBAFRICA’s larger push for women’s empowerment in Africa. This initiative sought to enhance women’s access to healthcare, education, economic opportunity, and political engagement. He said that the goals of this comprehensive initiative were to remove gender inequity, protect women’s rights, and foster a social environment that allows women to flourish. Omokungbe asserted that achieving women empowerment in Africa required an all-encompassing strategy involving the political, economic, medical, and educational spheres. He said African nations couldfoster a more equal society in which women might realise their full potential and make valuable contributions to the advancement of their country by investing in women’s empowerment. He said: “These renewed commitments would require collaboration and partnership among governments, Civil Society, the Private sector and International Organizations. They include the implementation of programmes and initiatives to promote women’s entrepreneurship, access to credit, land ownership, and participation in the formal economy including targeted support for women in agriculture and small businesses.” Commitment to increasing women’s representation in political leadership and decision-making positions through measures such as quotas, training programmes, and support for women’s political participation at all levels of government and comprehensive strategies to prevent and address gender-based violence including legal reforms, support services for survivors and campaigns to change social norms and attitudes that perpetuate violence against women.” President of WINBAFRICA, Dr Bukola Bello-Jaiyesimi, said that the event with the theme, “Bridging the Gap: Celebrating a decade of Nation Building ‘’ was designed to celebrate the legacy and advancement of women’s courses. “Nation-building is an ongoing effort carried out by women of every generation. As we reflect on our accomplishments over the past decade, we remain committed to empowering future generations in all sectors of the economy. We provide tuition, teaching equipment, and other resources to young girls and boys to show them that we care about their education and that they are the ones who will continue this effort. Our ultimate goal is to promote unity and peace and to inspire hope for a better future,” she presented. One of the highlights of the commemorative event was a school debate competition between Steady Steps School in Lekki and Bomak International Schools in Surulere, Lagos. Both schools advanced to the final round, where Victoria Osademe of Bomak International Schools, Surulere, Lagos won the WINBAFRICA Young Nation Builders’ Trophy (WYNBT) and Steady Steps School, Lekki emerged as the best speaker of the day. During the WINBAFRICA Business Roundtable, senior secondary students of Bomak International College in Surulere, Lagos discussed Environmental Responsibility. Additionally, 20 young girls and boys were beneficiaries of the WINBAFRICA scholarship program at the event. WINBAFRICA is a non-profit organization that implements various projects and interventions including Education First Series, Project Sapphire, Orphanage Challenge, Project Back-to-School, WINBAFRICA Monthly Round Table, WINBAFRICA Food Bank, and Monthly Newsletter production.

The post Measles: Why Nigeria, other countries risk more outbreaks in 2024 appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Nigeria, DR Congo Among Top 10 Countries With ‘Zero-dose’ Children From Nigeria to Europe, the United Kingdom and the U.S., measles is on the rise across the globe. Experts blame the situation on lack of vaccination and warn that if a case is not properly managed, it could lead to blindness, seizures, ‘deadly’ complications and lasting scars. They, however, call for more vaccination to avoid imminent nationwide outbreak since Nigeria is among the top 10 countries with unvaccinated or “zero-dose” children. Travelling during the holidays comes with many risks such as overbooked flights, delays, bad weather and exposure to COVID-19. Now, people can add exposure to measles to the list. Measles is a viral disease that causes a characteristic rash. Measles is endemic to Nigeria and outbreaks peak during the dry, hot season, between November and March. The situation is worsened by vaccine hesitancy and rejection. Till now, some parents reject the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine because of its association with developmental problems in Nigeria. The vaccine is also costly and is not always available for free on the routine immunisation programme. However, the MMR vaccine is no stranger to controversy. In 1998, a study published in The Lancet linked the vaccine to serious health risks in children, including autism and inflammatory bowel disease. But in 2010, the journal debunked that study, citing unethical practices and incorrect information. Since then, many research studies have looked for a connection between the MMR vaccine and these conditions. No connection has been found. With an “alarming” nearly 45-fold increase in measles cases in Europe last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that Nigeria and other countries with near zero immunisation rate are at risk. Health chiefs are warning that cases are still rising and “urgent measures” are needed to prevent further spread. Some 42,200 people were infected in 2023, compared to 941 during the whole of 2022. Despite reports of outbreaks in Abia and Sokoto states, experts believe that measles cases and fatalities have been under-reported in Nigeria and pose risk for disease management. The WHO believes this is a result of fewer children being vaccinated against the disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK, health officials said last week that an outbreak of highly contagious measles in the West Midlands could spread rapidly to other towns and cities with low vaccination rates. Millions of parents and caregivers are being contacted and urged to make an appointment to ensure their children are fully vaccinated against measles. The MMR vaccine is given in two doses – the first around the age of one and the second when a child is about three years and four months old. Speaking about the situation in Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, Regional Director at the WHO, said: “We have seen, in the region, not only a 30-fold increase in measles cases, but also nearly 21,000 hospitalisations and five measles-related deaths. This is concerning. Vaccination is the only way to protect children from this potentially dangerous disease.” According to the WHO Fact Sheet on Measles, symptoms of measles usually begin 10 to14 days after exposure to the virus. A prominent rash is the most visible symptom. Early symptoms usually last for four to seven days. They include running nose, cough, red and watery eyes and small white spots inside the cheeks. The rash begins about seven to18 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over within three days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts five to six days before fading. Most deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease. Complications can include blindness, encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections and severe breathing problems including pneumonia. If a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight. Complications are most common in children under five years and adults over 30 years. They are more likely in children who are malnourished, especially those without enough Vitamin A or with a weak immune system from Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) or other diseases. Measles itself also weakens the immune system and can make the body “forget” how to protect itself against infections, leaving children extremely vulnerable. Who is at risk? Any non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe measles complications. According to a new report released by WHO and the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more children died from measles in 2022 than 2021. The data serves as an urgent call to action – placing renewed attention on the importance of life-saving vaccines. Last year, 136,200 people, most of them children, died from measles. That is why it’s imperative that children everywhere get the necessary two doses of the measles vaccines, which are 97 per cent effective at preventing measles infections for life. Measles cases are also on the rise; the data show a jump in the number of people with measles, surging from seven million in 2021 to nine million in 2022. The increases in both number of deaths and cases reflect the severity of the disruption of routine health services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Measles cases anywhere in the world pose a risk to all countries and communities where immunisation coverage is below 95 per cent. In 2022, 37 countries were affected by large or disruptive measles outbreaks, nearly double the number of countries in 2021. Because measles outbreaks most often occur in un- or under-vaccinated communities, outbreaks point to weaknesses and inequities in immunisation programmes and other essential health services. Understanding where and why outbreaks happen can help public health officials deliver tailored solutions to ensure measles and other vaccinations are available to and accessed by all,” the WHO said. So far, nine lower-income countries have planned and rolled out follow-up vaccination campaigns in an accelerated effort with Gavi support: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Sudan, Cameroon, Malawi, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Yemen, Syria and Nigeria. Two of these countries (DRC and Nigeria) are among the top 10 countries with unvaccinated or “zero-dose” children. An additional three countries are scheduled to roll out campaigns: Chad, Central African Republic and Sudan. Meanwhile, the Abia State government last week raised awareness over the suspected outbreak of measles in Arochukwu and Umunneochi local councils of the state. The Commissioner for Information and Culture, Okey Kanu, who briefed journalists after the Executive Council meeting last week, said the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Ngozi Okoronkwo, and her team, were actively working to contain the disease from spreading. Explaining the situation, the health commissioner, Okoronkwo, said the state government was in control of the reported outbreak involving three persons in the two local councils. She pointed out that her ministry was at a mop up stage to ensure that the disease does not spread to other parts of the state, adding that the outbreak may be connected with the dry season. The Director-General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, has also harped on the importance of understanding the dynamics of diseases historically associated with outbreaks during the dry season like Lassa fever, meningitis and measles. He noted that heightened community awareness and environmental challenges from climate change and human activities contribute to the increased reported cases during this period. As the nation continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCDC has launched a comprehensive five-year strategic plan to strengthen its capacity and optimise engagement with stakeholders. The plan serves as a roadmap to protect the health of Nigerians, building on lessons and infrastructural gains acquired during the pandemic. Adetifa underscored the agency’s commitment to being strategic and ambitious, emphasising the need to scale with speed. He also highlighted the importance of strengthening collaborations with sub-national stakeholders, including the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) recognising the vital role of states and local councils in ensuring health security. According to the WHO, there is no specific treatment for measles. Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications. Drinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important. Doctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections. All children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths. Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive. Routine measles vaccination combined with mass immunisation campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than $1 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible. You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"President Bola Tinubu has renewed commitment to revive the 970 Tsangaya integrated schools to cater for the needs of out-of-school children in Northern Nigeria. Tinubu, who revealed this yesterday, at the grand finale of 38th Convocation ceremony of Bayero University, Kano, said investment in all aspect of education will be prioritised by his administration. The revitalisation of Tsangaya schools may reactivate integrated education system of Almagiria system including the N15b integrated centres established by former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2012 but now abandon. Tinubu, represented by Minister of Education, Professor Tahir Mamman, said his administration would continue to support education because of its pivotal impact on human capital development. Assuring of his readiness to improve investment at all levels of education, Tinubu said special focus will be on skill acquisition, technology and vocational education as core drivers of his administration’s policy. The president disclosed that to actualise the plan, preparation has been concluded to build 24 skill and vocational hubs in public polytechnics as well as entrepreneurship centres in some universities. He said inauguration of Private Sector Innovation Enterprise Centre, a coordinating centre, will soon be established across the country to deliver on the skill acquisition programme of the government. On his part, Senate President, Godswill Akpabio pledged the National Assembly’s commitment to support Federal Government’s policy on education. He said the Senate under his leadership will run a people centric legislature that improve on the lives of Nigerians. Earlier, the Vice Chancellor, Bayero University, Professor Sagir Adamu Abbas, appealed to the Federal Government to rescue the university from energy supply challenge and insecurity, rising from lack of perimeter fencing at the main campus of the institution. 11, 240 graduated during the convocation ceremony, comprising undergraduate and postgraduate as well as students of Dangote Business School. Also, the university awarded President of African Development Bank, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina and Deputy Senate President, Senator Barau Jibril, honorary doctorate degrees of Business administration and Law respectively for their contributions to national development.

According to Fubara, the feeling of liberation has propelled the people to organise special thanksgiving for his legal victory in the 23 local councils of the state without his prompting. The governor stated this at a special ceremony organised by the Okrika Council of Chiefs and the people of Okrika to honour the Amanyanabo of Okochiri Kingdom, King Ateke Tom, which was held at the Okrika National School field yesterday. The governor said the basis of development is anchored on peace, noting that nobody can ever get the best out of himself or from the society without a measure of peace. “If you love your state, you will not be part of anything that will bring destruction to it. It doesn’t matter who the person is. That is what people should understand. “And for those of us who chose peace, it is not because we are weak but because we know and value this state. Whatever achievement that has been recorded by the previous administration, it is important that we sustain it. And that is the reason we toe the path of peace,” he said. Speaking further, Fubara said: “Look at what is happening in the 23 local government areas of the state. I am not asking anybody to go round to do thanksgiving as some of you might be thinking. “These are people who wake up in the morning and say we have been liberated. We want to tell people that we exist. “And every day you are seeing the numbers; this is not artificial; this is organic support. And why are we getting it? It is because of the peace that we stand for.” The governor said public office holders should not talk carelessly, stressing that because he is not a noise maker but a prudent leader, his achievements would be displayed publicly at the appropriate time. Fubara promised to commence reconstruction work on the Isaka Community Landing Jetty and activate the sand filling project that was abandoned in the area. He also pronounced the upgrade, from second class status to a first class status, the traditional stool upon which King Ateke Tom sits. In his welcome address, former Minister of Transport, Chief Abiye Sekibo, said the Wakirike nation was celebrating one of their own, King Ateke Tom, who has contributed to the prevailing peace in its various communities and the Niger Delta. Sekibo, who extended the congratulation of the people to Fubara over his electoral victory, commended him for his decision to ensure the reign of peace, assuring him that Wakirike Be Se would continue to support his administration into its second tenure.

       "   'content': \"The National President of Fix Nigeria Group, Tunde Eso, has called on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the Lagos State Gvernor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to implement a national agenda of youth inclusion in governance.Eso said this at the group’s meeting held, on Wednesday, in Lagos. Eso said the recent economic policies of the Federal Government had led to unprecedented social vices, both in Lagos and other parts of Nigeria, adding that the adverse economic policies of government also created unimaginable high cost of living among the citizens. He, however, suggested the inclusion of youths in governance to arrest and reduce the rate of criminality in the country. Eso also urged the Federal Government on the need to implement an effective national policy implementation of youth agenda in collaboration with the states by providing empowerment programmes that will get the youths engaged, get them off the streets, and make them productive and responsible citizens for a better Nigeria. The Lagos State Coordinator of the group, Moses Olubobola,, said youth inclusion in governance could not be over-emphasised as “it is of vital importance in bridging Nigeria’s leadership gap,” adding that if purposefully implemented, could bring about robust governance. Sixty percent of Nigeria’s population is under the age of 30 years, which is the lowest in Africa.” According to INEC in the just concluded elections, young people made up about 75% of the newly registered voters. Despite this, youths are under-represented in elective positions in government. Nigerian youths have achieved outstanding landmarks in sports, the academia, entertainment, the corporate world, and entrepreneurship locally and internationally. This is a clear manifestation that our youths can also excel in governance when offered the opportunity. Olubobola therefore calls the president, his excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu to implement a national policy on youth inclusion in governance for the good of Nigerians in all sectors of the economy. The Public Relations Officer of Fix Nigeria Group, Lagos State, Comrade Taofeek Olowu, urged the Lagos State government to create a new policy on free education, youth inclusion in governance, provision of free healthcare, and affordable cum seamless transportation facilities in Lagos. In his contribution, Comrade Seun Akande, the Lagos State Secretary of Fix Nigeria Group, said despite the economic challenges facing our great nation, there are abundance of blessings and natural endowments staring at us without noticing them. He reiterated that Nigeria is blessed with abundant natural resources, talented, and brilliant people, both young and old, yet majority of our citizens live in abject poverty. He said further that Lagos is the richest state in Nigeria, yet there are unmotorable roads in our major cities, no standard first class hospital, we do not enjoy uninterrupted power supply in our homes and offices, the educational system is in a bad shape where students stay at home for several months due to avoidable strike actions by teachers and lecturers However, despite all these, he believes there is still light at the end of the tunnel saying there is still something that gives us hope of a better Nigeria. Our youths are still the hope we have for a better nation. Therefore there is a need to encourage the present administration to engage the youth more in governance to enhance transformation and development in our nation. He appealed to the local, state and federal government will look inward and engage more youth into governance for the change that we desire in Nigeria saying this is not the time to apportion blames for our past mistakes, but rather the right time to wake up from our slumber. Any nation that fails to develop it’s youth should expect a devastating future. Therefore,we must take the bull by the horns and do the needful before it’s too late. The state youth leader, Comrade Monday Yusuf appeals to Governor Sanwo-Olu to improve on power supply in the state to reduce criminality. Mrs Toyin Yusuf, Lagos State Women Leader of Fix Nigeria Group, urged the states and federal government to allow more women and Youthocrats participation in governance and empowerment for a better Nigeria.

Speaking in Abuja, while receiving a delegation from the Ladi Memorial Foundation (LMF), the Minister of State for Education, Dr. Yusuf Sununu, said there were growing opportunities for export in the garment industry that should be harnessed by young minds. He gave an example of how they were in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during the African Union meeting, the 2024 summit and throughout the period, the President was wearing clothes and cap made in Nigeria. “That’s an inspiration and I was so amazed when the President of Brazil came to President Tinubu and requested to have similar clothes from Nigeria. It shows we have a lot of talents in Nigeria”. “If you look at the eight-point agenda and education priority focus, you will find out that skill is a major thematic area, that is why we are making efforts to review the curriculum to reintegrate and focus towards skill acquisition.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"When Nigeria passed the Inland and Coastal Shipping (Cabotage) Act into law in 2003, a provision was made for the establishment of a Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF) to support indigenous businesses and Nigerian citizens grow their capacity in the carriage of the country’s maritime trade. Over the last 17years, succeeding Director Generals of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) have regaled industry operators with promises of disbursing accruals from the Fund, yet not a single USD or Naira has been disbursed to the frustration of prospective beneficiaries. The recent excuse is that parties are trying to resolve the interest rate or commission on the accrued funds; clearly this is not the way matters of this nature are handled in other climes. The CVFF is meant to grow the per capita water transport infrastructure stock of Nigeria, enhance domestic trade and enable indigenous operators access foreign markets. The main accrual to the Fund is the 2 per cent surcharge on carriage contracts performed by vessels engaged in domestic or inland shipping in Nigeria. It is important to stress that this 2 per cent surcharge comes from the payment for the use of the vessel; it is more like a contributory or toll tax that a vehicle owner has to make while crossing an interstate expressway, highway, tunnels or bridge. The surcharge is deducted by the consignee and paid to government from the freight invoice of the ship-owner for the use of Nigeria’s waterways. The NIMASA establishment Act of 2007 made very clear its role of promoting and regulating matters of maritime safety, security, marine pollution and maritime labour. The Agency is also charged with the responsibility of implementing the Merchant Shipping Act (2007) as amended, and the Cabotage Act 2003. Among its functions (Sections 22 and 23 of the NIMASA Act) is the development and regulation of matters relating to merchant shipping and seafarers, however NIMASA has little to do with waterborne transport infrastructure. Until the Nigerian constitution along with its subsidiary legislations is amended, the Supreme Court by its recent pronouncement has affirmed the status of the NIWA as the agency with the responsibility to improve and develop inland waters for navigation in Nigeria. For emphasis, the NIWA extant legislation declared navigable waterways in Nigeria to include rivers and their tributaries, distributaries, creeks, lakes, lagoons and intra-coastal waterways – excluding waters declared to be approaches to ports under or pursuant to the Nigerian Ports Authority Act. The NIWA establishment law (including the composition of its board) recognizes its role in waterborne transport infrastructure development.Part III of the NIWA Act states that “it shall be the functions of the Authority to (a) provide regulations for inland navigation; (b) ensure the development of infrastructural facilities for a national waterways network connecting the creeks and the rivers with economic centers using the river-ports as nodal points for intermodal exchange; and (c) ensure the development of indigenous technical and managerial skill to meet the challenges of modern inland waterways transportation.” Without reliable waterways infrastructure, there can never be efficient water transportation or shipping. The marine highways provide the space and connections to other modes for physical distribution of goods and persons. As Nigeria’s flag and port state administration, NIMASA is to focus on the integrity of the vessel and safety of those onboard the vessel (crew and passengers) as well as those living or working near bodies of water from hazards or harmful external threats, it is not established to provide waterways infrastructure (fixed installations, structures and networks) that facilitates the movement of goods and persons. To put in context, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) is the federal agency on road safety administration; however the development and maintenance of federal roads is the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Works and its agency, the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA). With huge water bodies connecting about 28 states of the federation, better use of inland water transportation will enable Nigeria leapfrog her economy into the first ten leading economies in another decade. The country’s estimated 3,800km of navigable waters available all year is able to transport over 50 per cent of perishable, manufactured and heavy goods currently being moved on Nigerian roads. The cargo transported on the Rhine River in Western Europe, which is about 1,300km long, was 292 million tonnes in 2022 alone. The under-performance of inland waterways in Africa generally has been linked to historical and institutional neglect. The biggest challenge for waterways underdevelopment in Nigeria has been poor funding, in strong contrast to the huge financial allocations committed every year to land infrastructure (road and rail). Since 2014 when the Federal Government announced a water transport infrastructure plan detailing the construction and rehabilitation of thirty-two waterborne infrastructure projects comprising eleven river ports and twenty-one jetties, very little has been heard or seen regarding its actualization till date. The new Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy would largely be ineffective without significant and sustained investments in waterborne transport infrastructure. Clearly, the current system of annual budgetary allocations is sufficient to bridge the huge infrastructural gap needed to expand and improve the country’s marine economy. The CVFF, which is a contribution paid by operators involved in domestic or inland shipping, should be made to serve and promote their interests. The unending controversy over the non-disbursement of the CVFF that has culminated in the long neglect of domestic shipping, ship building and water routes, demands that a new course of action is adopted by the supervising authority. A good start will be to sponsor an amendment to the extant Cabotage Act, whereby the CVFF is repurposed as a vehicle for waterborne transport infrastructure development and its administration placed under NIWA. But before transferring such a responsibility to NIWA, itscurrent operating structure should be rejigged and populated with requisite professionals.Thiswould accelerate Nigeria’s transition into a leading maritime nation, both in content and culture.

       "   'content': \"Many Nigerians, including businesses, rely on road transportation to move their goods from one part of the country to another. Despite being the major means of transportation especially for businesses, most of the country’s roads are in parlous state. They are either not accessible or filled with different sizes of potholes and craters. These have raised dire consequences for businesses across Nigeria writes GBENGA SALAU. On January 3, 2024 a truck upturned while trying to navigate through the multiple potholes on Agege Motor Road in Mushin area of Lagos. The incident happened in the day time. From eyewitness account, the driver was not on speed, the accident occurred because the truck driver did not understand the terrain. He had driven into one of the big potholes within the corridor uninformed. As a result, the truck carrying a container tilted and eventually fell. Sometime, in June 2022, one person was injured when a truck laden with a 20-ft container fell in Lagos. The incident happened around the rail crossing in Yaba when an articulated truck was trying to navigate a bad portion of the road. In its account of the incident, the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) said: “Upon arrival at the incident scene, an articulated truck laden with a 20ft container was found accidented at the railway crossing at the aforementioned location.” The Permanent Secretary of LASEMA, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, in an update on the incident, said further investigation “revealed that the truck driver poorly navigated the bad sections of the road and as a result, the truck overturned onto the rail tracks.” Accidents like this are not limited to Lagos. There are many occurrences across Nigeria, where businesses and transporters suffer from the bad state of the roads in the country. In some instances, robbers also use bad spots on roads as places to waylay articulated vehicles to divert such vehicles to steal the goods being conveyed. And the Director General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, in a chat with The Guardian, disclosed that such mishaps are daily occurrences all over Nigeria with dire consequences on businesses, especially manufacturers. Data has it that about 90 per cent of goods and people in Nigeria are moved by road, so, road transportation dominates other modes of transport like rail, air and water. This implies road are essential in the facilitation of movement and trade across the country. Ironically, most of the roads in the country are in deplorable state as they are dotted with varied sizes of potholes and gullies. The resultant effect is the damage to not just vehicles, but also goods being conveyed by the articulated vehicles, leading to increase distribution, production and product costs as well as downtime in meeting supplies and consumers’ demands. From North to West, East and South of the country, there are several dreadful roads inflicting pains on businesses, their managers and economic activities generally that roads were meant to aid. From the bypass in Benin, Edo State connecting the Sapele Road to Upper Sokponba Road, Agbor Road, and the Benin-Auchi Road terminating at the Benin-Lagos Expressway, all within the south-south region of the country are in terrible state. A portion of bad road dotting the country Also, the Benin-Auchi-Okenne-Lokoja Highway is in poor state with section from Urokuosa community near Benin City to Ewu, in Edo Central most hit, while the Okpella to Okene road in Kogi State, the story is not any better. Similarly, the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway, Lagos-Badagry-Seme Expressway, East-West Road, North-East Link Road, Ekpoma-Abuja Highway, Jos/Bauchi/Gombe Road, Kabba, Ayetoro Gbede, Egbe -Ilorin Road, Lagos /Abeokuta Expressway, Jos-Kaduna Road, Itokin/Ikorodu Road, Keffi-Nasarawa-Borno Road, Abuja-Lambata-Bida Road, Calabar – Itu- Road are just a few of the major roads expected to make possible intra and inter-trade in Nigeria, but these roads are a pain in the neck for businesses and their management, because of the awful state of the roads. The Minister of Works, David Umahi, recently captured the dreadful state of Nigerian roads after taking a tour around the country to have firsthand information about the state of federal roads. Hear him: “On the whole, to address our road sector for the next four years, we would need about N18.6 trillion, and so, the National Assembly must have to wear its thinking cap on how we can address seriously our road sector. “When you ask me to go and intervene on certain roads, which have collapsed, and I have to liken the situation to a man on life support. The man needs immediate attention. Where there is an emergency, the road is cut and the people are suffering, movement is stopped, it needs an emergency. So, we appeal for contingency to respect your directives on fixing emergency situations.” Umahi pointed out that some roads are riddled with not just potholes but ‘boreholes’. He was also dismayed at how contractors cheat Nigerians with the materials being deployed for the construction of roads across the country. He observed that: “There is no project being constructed right now in Nigeria that is going to last for seven years. The question is: Are we going to be maintaining or reconstructing our roads every 10 years? “That is what we have been doing. I travelled from Abuja to Benin City through Lokoja, all the stretches of the road are on contract, and ongoing, this is through the policy of the last administration but how much of the roads are motorable? “I travelled through the roads myself and I shed tears for the kind of pain our people are going through. I spent 14 hours on the road having started my journey at 10:00am and got to Benin City at 2:00pm the next day and I was very happy I experienced the pains. “Unless the President does something about our procurement, his lofty intention to help this country may not be achieved. Documents will be sent to the Bureau of Public Procurement for a no-objection certificate and it will stay for six months. How will the contractors do the additional job you directed them to do without backup authorisation.” And business concerns that suffer from the horrible state of roads across the country include small, medium and large organisations. These businesses include transporters, importers, exporters, manufacturers, haulage companies, marketers as well as farmers to mention a few. Although the minister of works gave an account of the dilapidated condition of federal roads across the state, the deplorable nature of roads in the country is, however, not limited to just the federal roads. Many of the state and council roads across Nigeria are not better managed compared with the Federal roads. Of note is that Nigeria’s road network and infrastructure across the six geopolitical zones is estimated to be about 200,000km in length of which 18 per cent are said to belong to the Federal Government, that is about 36,000km, while state governments superintend about 16 per cent of the country’s roads put at 32,000km, just as 66 per cent of the nation’s roads are managed by the local government, estimated to be 132,000km. Sharing his experience about plying Nigerian roads, a truck driver, Ariyo Babatunde, said driving at night is even more precarious for many truck drivers, as most of the roads are not properly illuminated with streetlights, so many drivers run into potholes and gullies that naturally upturns articulated vehicles. Providing insight on how bad roads across the country have consequences on their operations, the National Coordinator, 100 per cent Compliance Team of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Ibrahim Tanko, said the deplorable state of the roads across the country is negatively affecting not just citizens, but also businesses. According to him, it hampers the ability to connect one part of the country with another smoothly. “I do not know nor understand why government decided to just neglect the roads, may be because most of our leaders do not use the roads to connect one part of the country with another, as they usually use the air means of transportation. May be that is why they decided to abandon the roads. And it is not good, because it is affecting not just transporters, but also the economy.” Asked to provide an estimate of the number of times that trucks get upturned monthly, Ogungbemi disclosed that as a union they had not taken time to take statistics, but like the Director General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), he said trucks upturning and getting stuck in bad roads is almost a daily occurrence across the country’s highways and roads. “Trucks are falling into ditches daily and it is an eyesore that it is happening in almost every part of the country. We can only appeal to the authorities to at least see that they maintain these roads. I am even surprised that some roads would have minimal potholes, but rather than fix and patch them, the government and its agencies will abandon it and wait till the potholes become craters that would cost more money and time to fix before deciding to look into repairing such road after much cry from the populace. “It is affecting us negatively, so, we are calling on government to see how they can embark on serious road rehabilitation across the country. Also, while government agencies often stop vehicles, and sometimes, impound vehicles for not having road-worthiness certification or not being road worthy, who holds governments accountable for the many bad roads across the country that is not vehicle worthy?” Ogungbemi asked. In the same vein, commenting on the negative implications of bad roads for businesses, the Director General of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria said that sometimes consignments are lost to accident on the way to being delivered to the wholesalers due to dilapidated roads. “And even some of our raw materials, especially those being moved from remote areas to the factories, they suffer the same fate in some cases because of the breakdown of the trucks. And the perishable goods, we lose the raw materials, when the vehicle conveying them upturned. “Very importantly, the cost of moving goods because of the bad road is also a major concern which affects the prices of products, sometimes leading to consumers’ apathy. Thus, we are not able to sell as we should. This is because when we put the cost on our end product, the price becomes higher. “Furthermore, it compounds insecurity. If the roads are in good state and safe, there would not be slowing down in many spots that robbers easily accost trucks on the road with the intent to divert them and steal the consignment. “All these are seen as cost, because it puts demand on time, resources and production process.” With roads dominating the means of commuting and moving goods, no doubt, there is a need to rethink the process of moving goods across the country considering there are other modes of transportation. And the DG of MAN agreed, calling on the government to reduce the pressure on roads by considering seriously extending the rail network. “This is because with rail you can transport more cargo better and cheaper. The cost of diesel has worsened the matter. Food inflation is also linked to the state of the road.” Ajayi-Kadir also could not provide an exact estimate of what businesses lose to bad roads yearly but guess it runs into billions of naira. Speaking, Dr Madu Obiora, an expert on haulage activities, could also not provide statistics or estimates to what is being lost to bad roads by businesses, saying “It is very difficult to get the figure, but the fact is that it is massive, a whole lot and these things are causing supply chain disruption. “Raw materials that are heading to factories either cannot get or get there late and the factory will have to stop production because it did not arrive. The losses are not only financial.” Pressed to give a clue in naira and kobo of the likely loses businesses suffer, quoting a report in one of the national dailies, he said stakeholders disclosed that Nigeria is losing about $8.1 billion, which is about N3.6trn to poor infrastructure, inefficiency and corruption at the seaport. He, however, put a caveat that he cannot vow for the figures, but it gives an idea of the kind of challenges businesses face. Obiora, however, supported the statistics that revealed that most of the transportation of goods and persons are done through road, maintaining it is not good development. “And this is why Nigerian products are not competitive abroad, that is why the manufacturing sector is dying. The non-competitiveness of our economy is as a result of poor logistic infrastructure and until we fixed it, we would have a lot of issues to grapple with. “Look at those that are running logistic business, you buy a new vehicle, after a short while, the vehicle is gone, you have to replace it. Of course, foreign exchange rate is escalating on a daily basis” If you see anybody running business, especially logistic business, doff your hat for the person, it is not easy, because Nigeria is one of the most difficult places you can run logistic services.” Obiora, nonetheless, maintained that though businesses bear the burden of bad roads, but they pass some of the cost to the consumers. “At the end of the day, the cost is added on, because the person has to remain in business and the consumers bear the brunt. Look at the cost of things in the market, how many manufacturing company lines have shutdown. “In navigating the bad road, the trucks might be forced to take a longer route and as you take a longer route, you are burning diesel. “I remember speaking to the chief executive of a major manufacturing company that was here years back when we were doing impact analysis on export expansion grant. And he told me, he actually showed me the figures, two of his factories are not connected to the national grid, which means 24 hours the factories were on generator because of the sensitivity of the machines. And he said then that if nothing happens, end is in sight and five years later, the company left but the company’s importation arm is still in Ijora.” On her part, the Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr Chinyere Almona, said LCCI is deeply concerned about the ongoing challenges faced by businesses in Nigeria, particularly, those operating in the logistics and transportation sector. “We have been made aware of the specific issues raised by a leading player in the sector with an established footprint in Nigeria’s economic landscape over many decades. “Stakeholders in the logistics and transportation sector serve major national and multinational companies and play a critical role in ensuring the smooth movement of goods across the country. These players and the companies they serve experience grave difficulties, which impact the overall cost of doing business. “One of the key issues highlighted by transporters is the alarming delays experienced by their drivers on federal highways due to the dilapidation of the road network, which, in turn, adversely affects their cash flow, increases maintenance costs in addition to the impact of foreign exchange volatility on imported spare parts and tires. “These challenges, combined with a lack of a clear government strategy to support businesses in the sector, have far-reaching consequences for the overall economic landscape. “The impact extends across the business community as the survival of companies is intricately linked to the efficient and timely transportation of their products, and any disruptions in this supply chain have a ripple effect on their operations, the businesses they support, and ultimately the consumers.” She, therefore, called on government to urgently address these challenges and engage in a constructive dialogue with stakeholders in the logistics and transportation sector. “A clear and comprehensive strategy is needed to streamline operations on federal highways, address the volatility in foreign exchange, and foster an environment conducive to business growth,” Almona stated.

       "   'content': \"The Coalition for United Political Parties (CUPP) has faulted President Bola Ahmed Tinubu over his scathing remarks against the nationwide strike action embarked on by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) last week. CUPP’s National Secretary, Chief Ameh Peter, in a statement, called for the immediate fulfilment of the agreements government entered into with the NLC to alleviate the suffering Nigerian workers are passing through. CUPP noted that rather than the use intimidation to silence NLC and by extension Nigerians from demanding for good governance, it behooves on Tinubu to bear in mind that no democracy flourishes and becomes entrenched without all the rights as contained in the 1999 Constitution as amended, and Universal Declaration on Human Rights, including the right to free speech, assembly and peaceful protests. CUPP was reaction to the remarks attributed to Tinubu at the commissioning of the Red Line Railway Project in Lagos on February 29, 2024 wherein he lashed out at the NLC and its leadership for daring to call on Nigerian workers to embark on strike action against the hardship in the country. Piqued by the development, the coalition noted: “The democratic space must never be constricted, which was essentially what the utterances of the president portrayed. Rather, it should be expanded to accommodate all different and differing opinions, including the right to dissent. “Nigerians have never had it so bad, and the circumstances that led to the Arab spring were not this bad. Feeding which is almost given has suddenly become an abstract concept to many Nigerian homes, and Tinubu expects the labour movement which represents the majority of the downtrodden and underprivileged in our country to keep quiet and look the other way while those at the helm of affairs are living larger than life as if all was well. “We in CUPP now firmly believe in the adage that says, “He who kills by the sword will never allow a man with a sword to ever come close to him, even by a country mile. “We remember how unrelenting Tinubu as both ACN and APC leader was condemning the then PDP led government with his unceasing criticisms of their policies, which were more humane and in nowhere asphyxiating as the immediate past and present APC administrations. “Nigerians are beginning to reminisce what was shouted from rooftops and condemned by the then former Governor Tinubu and APC as clueless to be the golden years of Nigerian democracy and economy. “Opposition parties and Nigerian Labour Congress were allowed to flourish without let or hindrance, the economy was booming, and Nigeria was then rated as the biggest and fastest growing economy in Africa.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"The Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke has unveiled his administration’s food security plan, just as he advocated national unity to resolve the current national economic crisis in the country. Adeleke, who opened up on the extensive agenda of the state on food security and expanded food production, at the office of the Minister of Agriculture, Senator Abubakar Kyari, in Abuja, accompanied by his Commissioner for Agriculture, Tola Faseru said “these are emergency eras in the economic life of this nation. “We therefore, have a duty to look and act beyond partisan politics and ensure collective efforts towards restoration of normalcy. A federation works best when component units join hands for common good. “It is in that line that I am here today. The first reason is to brief you on what the Osun State government is doing on the issue of food security and ongoing economic challenges facing the nation. “I am happy to report that the Osun government has been very proactive. First, we are setting up a State Security Trust Fund to mobilise financing for security agencies. This is going to be private sector driven. “Secondly, I conveyed a food security meeting to brainstorm on how to further secure our farmlands. I have met representatives of Hunters association and the Amotekun commanders alongside the civil defense and police services. The goal is to strengthen farm security. “Our administration is also working on Small Farmers’ Equipment Lending service. This is to ease the access of small scale farmers to tractors and other needed machineries. We are meeting this week to finalise the plan ahead of the onset of the rainy planting season. “To expand food production, we are also pushing to implement a City to Farm programme. This was designed to encourage young small scale farmers. This will expand production and also engage our youth,” he said. Governor Ademola said on a more general level, his administration recently unveiled a Cocoa Revival plan for the state. “It involves several activities which focus on moving Osun from third to first cocoa producer in Nigeria. We seek partnership with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture on this. “Our government is also interested in the livestock development programme. We have submitted our expression of interest, kindly help to facilitate early approval. “The state is also interested in the Agro-processing zones project being implemented under the African Development Bank (AfDB). I hosted a delegation of the AfDB in Osun weeks ago. Your ministry’s support on this is also solicited….” Responding, the minister commended the multi-partisan approach of the Governor to state governance, pledging to work on all the areas touched by the Governor. He restated the determination of President Bola Tinubu to address the national economic challenges, informing the delegation that the meeting with the Governor was part of a broad plan to ensure immediate resolution of the current dislocations within the economy.

       "   'content': \"The Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) yesterday said the Federal Government was working to attract the right investments that would ensure that the country meets its commitment to cut its carbon emission to net-zero by 2060. According to the commission, Nigeria needs $4 billion annually to fund clean energy generation initiatives. Director-General of ECN, Dr. Abdullahi Mustapha, disclosed this in Abuja, during the sensitization campaign on using improved clean energy held at Kurudu, Karu Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). At the event, the commission also donated technologically advanced cooking stoves to women as a demonstration of the benefits of cleaner cooking methods. “Let me mention here that during my presentation when we started this campaign yesterday, I made mention that we have from analysis and from research and studies as well, that the Nigerian government needs $4 billion yearly and I repeat $4 billion yearly for us to attain a clean energy generation. We have made a commitment to net zero, we’re all aware. “That means we must work towards it. And for us to do that, we must be able to attract at least $4 billion dollars yearly up to 2050 that we have pledged to cut the emission to net zero and hopefully by 2060 we will sign off. That is the Paris Agreement and that is what we have pledged to do. So, we are working towards getting the investment to the country,” he said. According to the ECN DG, cooking with traditional biomass stoves is a major source of household air pollution, which causes millions of premature deaths every year, especially among women and children. Mustapha lamented that the activity also contributes to deforestation, climate change and energy poverty, adding that these are serious challenges that the country must address. He added: “We are here today on a campaign on clean renewable energy efficiency juice for domestic cook stoves. It is very necessary because what they are using traditionally is very harmful to their heads. It is contributing to global warming and as such, it is causing degradation of the environment. So, we are here to give them a better solution, a more technological advanced cooking stove that will reduce those emissions, the carbon emission and also increase efficiency. “Now, it will interest you to notice that based on our studies, about three billion households use a very harmful cooking stove around the world. If you do that analysis, you know the carbon that has been flipped. And that is why we are having climate change. So, with what we’re doing today, we are sure to reduce that number. And Nigeria is taking a bold step to cut the emission of carbon.” You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

The contraband seizures are five sacks of pangolin scales; 398 sacks of Indian hemp, weighing 8,756kg and another 2,308 compressed parcels of Indian hemp of 1kg each. The five sacks of pangolin scales weighing 413.1kg and the 11,064kg of Indian hemp are the highest, if not arguably the first seizure of such endangered species and hard drugs in the history of the zone. Also intercepted were; 31 cartons of various medicaments including tramadol; 32 jerry cans of petrol and 540 pieces of used tyres and between July 25 and September 23, 2023, the FOU Zone C intercepted cannabis sativa; raw materials for production of explosive devices, as well as other contraband with a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N1.6 billion.The Zone also arrested nine suspects in connection with the seizures. Other items seized are fake pharmaceutical products, tramadol, used vehicles, used tyres, used clothing and explosive raw materials among others.In total, the unit further seized goods worth over N5 Billion in the total Duty Paid Value (DPV) category in the 2023 fiscal year. Also, in the year under review, the officers of the unit under the leadership of Compt. Kolade, the unit raised Demand Notice (DN) worth over N152m to fraudulent importers, thereby, saving the Federal Government revenue that would have hitherto been lost to fraudulent importers. However, a clearing agent operating at the Onne seaport, Chukwu Okenwa, applauded Kolade for blocking revenue leakages from the eastern port.

       "   'content': \"The Chairman, Presidential Committee on Tax Reform and Fiscal Policy, Taiwo Oyedele, has revealed that the committee is working to ensure that a single-digit number of taxes is achieved across all levels of government. He stated this in Lagos at the Nigerian German Chamber of Commerce Business Success Morning Seminar. The event was held in collaboration with the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Nigeria known as (AHK) with the theme ‘Tax and Fiscal Incentives for Nigerian Businesses Foreign Investment.’ Oyedele disclosed that the committee targets a minimum tax-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio of 18 per cent within the next three years. He added that the committee was planning to rewrite all the major tax laws so that instead of amending the laws, a new law would be enacted. “There are also plans to set up the office of Tax Ombudsman to provide information that can produce insight to issues and resolutions. “We are working on a national tax policy for Nigeria. We want to use the opportunity to update the national tax policy and also include policies for Nigeria about spending and borrowing and to tackle the cost of governance and quality of spending,” Oyedele said. Director General, NGCC, Marilyn Rapu, explained that the business success series are organised to address the economic challenges businesses are facing, adding that the presentation by Oyedele was meant to enlighten businesses on latest tax incentives. “It becomes crucial for both local and foreign investors seeking opportunities in Nigeria’s dynamic market to find out what incentives are available and also to fully understand the plans and government policies that promote the ease of doing business in Nigeria,” she said. Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Kaiser Construction and President of the Nigerian German Chamber, Igbuan Okaisabor, said the government needs to make sure that the private sector develops because reliance on government is not really sustainable. His words: “The recommendations from the Committee are commendable and are expected to contribute immensely to tackling some of the current economic challenges plaguing the country. A lot of companies have suffered from multiple taxation so the committee’s recommendation to shrink the number of taxes will be a win-win – beneficial to both the government (in terms of collection efficiency) and to businesses.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"Sets up marshall unit to guard 1,975 illegal mining sites Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, (NSCDC), has said that 1, 421 suspects have been arrested and 488 convicted for various acts of vandalization including oil theft, in the last three years. Commandant General, NSCDC, Dr. Ahmed Audi, made this known at the 2024 celebration of the World Civil Defense Day, weekend in Abuja. He said the Corps has intensified patrol, monitoring, surveillance and emplaced adequate security measures to ensure protection of Critical National Assets and Infrastructure, (CNAI), in all its formations across the Country including the Federal Capital Territory to prevent violent attacks, willful damage, vandalization and sabotage. “The Corps’ Anti-Vandal Squad and the Commandant General’s Special Intelligence Squad has continued to wage relentless war against vandals of Critical National Assets and Infrastructure and oil thieves among others. “The sudden upsurge in the vandalization of railway tracks and sleepers is also being criticaly addressed as the Corps has begun an onslaught on these criminal elements/economic saboteurs. This renewed war has led to several arrests and seizures in the past one year.” Audi, who is also celebrating three years as CG, said “part of the achievements recorded from March, 2021 to date include 1,421 arrests, 933 prosecutions, 488 convictions and 233 destroyed illegal refineries.” He revealed that between January and February 2024 alone, the Corps has made significant impact in the war against vandalization and oil theft where over 57 suspects have been arrested. A greater percentage of the arrested vandals are those involved in the vandalization of railway tracks and sleepers. Stressing the importance of interagency collaboration to tackle insecurity, he said “On 11th January, 2024 at about 0057hrs, the Corps in conjunction with the Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited also arrested a vessel, MT KALI suspected to have been involved in oil theft at the sea in Beneti, Bayelsa State. “The Vessel was arrested with about 119 metric tons of crude oil already loaded. Twelve (12) crew members and eleven (11) community members on board were arrested and are undergoing investigation.” Minister of Interior, Dr. Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo who commissioned the new mining marshall unit of the agency, tasked personnel to brace up to perform the constitutional role of the agency. He said “I have not come here to commend you but rather to tell you to brace up as there is much more that needed to be done.” He pointed that the constitution is clear on the role of the Corps which is to secure the nation’s critical infrastructure but stressed the importance of collaboration between all security apparatus in the country to stem the tide of insecurity. The minister pointed to distinct roles in the constitution for both the Nigeria Police Force and the NSCDC and that there was no reason for a clash in roles. According to him, members of Civil Defence Corps have no reason to perform the role of the police as they have a duty to ensure that the nation’s oil pipelines are not vandalized and oil theft is a thing of the past. He equally said they have the duty of ensuring that a stop is put to illegal mining and that lives and property at mining sites are protection. Dr. Tunji-Ojo adds that though they have done so much but much more need to be done in ensuring that Nigeria’s natural resources is not stolen by vandals and that public infrastructure are protected. “I have not come here to commend you but rather to tell you to brace up as there is much more that needed to be done,” he said.

       "   'content': \"Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), has condemned the attack from suspected gun men on community where one was killed and six others still missing in Ledor community in Tai Local Council of Rivers State. The association also placed a curse on perpetrators as the incident over shooting of Chief Nule Yarakor, the deputy paramount ruler of the Ledor community, who is said to be in a critical condition and had been taken to a safe place for medical attention. MOSOP President Fegalo Nsuke, described it as “the return of barbarism,” warning against violent attacks on Ogoni residents.Nsuke called on the Ogoni people to remain calm and maintain good relations with business partners and their neighbours, adding that they “are working to bring the conflicts under control.” “We regret that the attack was coming at a time MOSOP was engaging in frantic efforts to find a lasting solution to the Ogoni problem. We may call on the people to defend themselves in the best ways possible.” According to Nsuke,the reported attacks on the residents of Ledor in the Ban Ogoi axis of Tai local government area signals the return of barbarism and oil company backed attacks against Ogoni. He declared : it is unfortunate that this attack is coming at a time we are making frantic efforts to resolve the Ogoni problem and we hope that it does not escalate to jeopardize our conflict resolution efforts. “The attack is coming barely 31 years after the community was besieged by Nigerian soldiers on the orders of the former military government under General Sanni Abacha leading to the death of hundreds of people.” The MOSOP leader therefore called on the Rivers Governor, Siminalayi Fubara and the federal government to take immediate steps to bring the situation under control noting that it is pertinent to get the NNPC to stay action in order not to cause a further deterioration in the security situation.

       "   'content': \"Solutions to multifaceted crises bedeviling Nigeria cannot be left for the government alone. The Bishop of Nike Diocese (Anglican Communion) Enugu State Rt Revd (Dr) Christian Onyeka Onyia in this interview with LAWRENCE NJOKU, called on Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), professional and religious bodies to join hands with the government to end the crises. Are there things that worry you about Nigeria? Undoubtedly, there are numerous facets of Nigeria that prompt profound concern and apprehension. The constant loss of lives, displacement of communities, and extensive disruption of daily life for countless Nigerians due to persistent security challenges, including insurgency, banditry, and various forms of violent conflicts across the nation, are deeply distressing. Regrettably, the response to these alarming events often falls short, leaving the citizens in a state of vulnerability and uncertainty. Notably, recent incidents, such as the tragic attacks around Mangu town in Plateau State in January 2024, where at least 43 lives were lost and numerous individuals were injured, underscore the urgent need for comprehensive action. The state of Nigeria’s economy and the struggle against poverty are issues that weigh heavily on my conscience, especially in my role as a Bishop. The staggering statistic that over 63 per cent (133 million) of Nigerians endure multidimensional poverty, compounded by escalating inflation and a tenuous exchange rate, underscores the pervasive hardship experienced by a significant portion of the population. Access to essentials such as healthcare, education, clean water, adequate sanitation, and basic sustenance is a dire challenge for many. Furthermore, disparities in wealth distribution, access to economic opportunities, and essential amenities persist across various regions, magnifying the urgency of addressing these disparities. Moreover, the pressing apprehensions surrounding political stability, governance, transparency, and public administration inefficiencies continue to loom large. The pervasive impact of corruption and the erosion of public trust in government institutions underscore the crucial need for substantial reforms and resolute action to foster a more transparent and efficient governance framework. Furthermore, the prevalence of political tensions and conflicts underscores the imperative of achieving inclusive and effective governance. While acknowledging the importance of bolstering security forces, it is equally vital to concentrate efforts on addressing the root causes of conflicts, including poverty, socioeconomic marginalisation, and limited opportunities. Enhancing coordination among security forces to confront insurgency, banditry, and other forms of violent conflict is essential. In pursuit of sustainable peace, dialogue and reconciliation efforts must be emphasised to foster understanding and harmony among diverse communities and groups. It is undeniable that a significant portion of Nigeria’s security and environmental sustainability challenges are rooted in the impacts of climate change. Therefore, it is imperative for Nigeria to demonstrate unwavering commitment, going beyond rhetoric, in the enactment of policies and implementation of initiatives aimed at mitigating deforestation, soil erosion, and pollution. This encompasses advocating sustainable land use practices and fostering the adoption of renewable energy sources. Such endeavors necessitate substantial investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and the dissemination of information about climate change adaptation strategies at the grassroots level. Effectively addressing these issues requires a confluence of political resolve, strategic resource allocation, adept governance, and the active engagement of civil society. Collaborative efforts among the government, private sector, and international partners will be pivotal in the successful execution of these strategies. Furthermore, cultivating a culture of constructive dialogue, inclusivity, and a steadfast commitment to human rights will be pivotal in fashioning a cohesive and thriving society. As Nigeria endeavors to confront these challenges, harnessing the potential of its diverse population and abundant resources will be crucial to attaining sustainable development and fostering prosperity for all its citizens. Furthermore, in considering the broader implications of court decisions, it is crucial to evaluate their alignment with constitutional provisions, human rights considerations, and the pursuit of justice within the societal and political context. As a neutral and unbiased person, I can only provide information on the principles that underpin fair and just legal processes, along with the factors that contribute to their assessment. In the broader context, there is a palpable sense of unease among Nigerians regarding certain court rulings on the 2023 elections. The implications of these decisions have sparked concerns over the integrity of Nigeria’s judiciary and have drawn significant attention. It is my considered opinion that a proactive approach should be taken, whereby all electoral disputes are resolved through judicial proceedings prior to the inauguration of elected officials. This initiative would serve to prevent any semblance of undue influence on the judiciary and allow elected leaders to focus on their responsibilities without the distraction and financial burden of protracted legal battles. It is essential to underscore the pivotal role that an independent and credible judiciary plays in upholding the rule of law and ensuring the equitable administration of justice. Decisions rendered by the judiciary, including those by the Supreme Court, are paramount in safeguarding the legitimacy of electoral processes and addressing any infractions or irregularities that may have occurred during elections. The judicial process must exemplify adherence to legal tenets, transparency, and the impartial application of the law, particularly in matters concerning electoral disputes.

       "   'content': \"Professor Victor Olawale Adetimirin of Plant Breeding and Crop Production, University of Ibadan, Oyo State has recommended the setting up of a Plant Breeding Rescue Agenda 2050 for Nigeria. This, he said, would address the development of improved varieties of food, feed, and fibre crops in a holistic manner that is One-Health oriented. He made the recommendation while delivering the 541st Inaugural Lecture of the university on behalf of the Faculty of Agriculture. Professor Adetimirin said the conception, implementation, and delivery of the agenda must have a strong Agricultural Extension component from the beginning to the end. He stressed that the agenda must be a Nigeria-for-Nigeria agenda, driven by Nigeria and fully funded by Nigeria, a demonstration that the country is ready to change her narrative positively among the comity of nations. Professor Adetimirin argued that Nigeria’s Plant Breeding Rescue Agenda 2050 cannot be funded by countries that Nigeria is struggling to liberate herself from. He said the agenda must not be the usual Nigerian thing! It must be free from politics, shenanigans, and corrupt practices. Professor Adetimirin said the agenda must have a zero budget for international trips as the expertise required to deliver it is within the shores of Nigeria. He said beyond addressing One-Health issue holistically, Agenda 2050 is proposed as an economic emancipation agenda that will not only ensure that Nigeria relocates all jobs associated with seed production of all crops to Nigeria, but also ensure that the billions of naira realised from the sale of seeds remain in Nigeria. The inaugural lecturer also called on the government to support relevant researchers and research institutions in Nigeria to develop improved varieties of all vegetable crops comparable in agronomic and consumer-preferred traits to arrest the importation of seeds of vegetable crops into Nigeria. He submitted further that no nation can be food secure without being seed secure. To this end, Professor Adetimirin said seed companies in Nigeria need to be given incentives to go into vegetable seed production of developed improved varieties to stop the uncontrolled influx of imported vegetable seeds into Nigeria.

       "   'content': \"A coalition of 50 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have faulted the Nigeria National Petroleum Limited, NNPCL over the acquisition of OVH Energy Marketing. The rights group under the auspices the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room argued that the deal was at variance with the President Tinubu’s renewed hope agenda. The group demanded for the sack and prosecution of the Group Chief Executive Officer, GCEO, NNPCL, Engr Mele Kyari, within 7 days over alleged infractions. The group in a petition alleged: “You, NNPCL GCEO, Mele Kyari, had told the House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee that the acquisition of OVH Energy was properly done and it gave the NNPCL over 30 per cent control of the downstream sector with a profit of N18.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a position which has been disputed by industry players as not backed by any documentary evidence. “It was gathered that the National oil company paid cash amounting to over $325.09 million (N140.559 billion) for the acquisition of Oando-branded retail stations and a reception jetty in Apapa, among other facilities with allegation trailing the acquisition that some of the acquired assets are alleged not to have belonged fully to OVH or licensed. “The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room therefore calls on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to take decisive action to contain your excesses as the GCEO of NNPC Limited. “Therefore, we are issuing a 7-day ultimatum to you, the GCEO of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, to resign from office or else we will storm the NNPC headquarters with over 500 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to protest against you. “The assets acquired from the company, which operates Oando filling stations, also include a reception jetty with 240,000 metric tonnes monthly capacity and eight liquefied petroleum gas plants, three lube blending plants, three aviation depots, and 12 warehouses. “But in June 2023, its investigation on the acquisition exposed the secret deals and the complicated ownership structure that left managerial control of NNPC Retail in the hands of OVH Energy Marketing. “The report also exposed how OVH Energy Marketing only had about 94 stations and how over 100 stations were leased. In addition, the report highlighted how Mr Stokman, an expatriate and former Chief Executive Officer, CEO, OVH Energy, emerged as the new Managing Director of NNPC Retail, a development that further compounded the structure of NNPC Retail. “The report was submitted by the Hon Hassan Nalaraba-led ad hoc committee investigating the controversial acquisition of OVH Energy Marketing Limited’s downstream assets by NNPC Limited after the panel presented a report many lawmakers described as “suspicious and shabby.” “The report was denied by members of the committee, who accused their chairman of failing to carry out a proper investigation as directed by the House but produced a report not signed by any member of the committee. “Therefore, the committee, tasked with investigating the controversial deal, was relieved of its duties during the consideration of the report on the investigation. The task was subsequently transferred to the House Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) for a fresh investigation.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"SIR: Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu promises to be one of Nigeria’s more courageous elected leaders. Emerging evidence points in that direction. His predecessors had fought shy of the twin contagions, among others, plaguing the Nigerian economy for decades; viz: subsidy on petroleum products, and the naira exchange rate. The minty president had barely assumed office when he decisively bid farewell to the dreaded “subsidy” and subsequently floated the Naira. This is a welcome change. The removal of subsidy on petroleum products can hardly be faulted for the obvious duplicity of the claim. None of the reasons which have been advanced for fuel subsidy could stand up to close scrutiny. For example, Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL), presently the sole importer of petroleum products into Nigeria couldn’t ascertain the quantities and qualities (Q and Q) of her importations, this is a huge joke. Here is the joke: under the Domestic Market Obligations (DMO) clause of Nigeria’s Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) with the International Oil Companies (IOCs), the crude oil earmarked for producing products for the Nigerian market is fully subsidized (discounted). So, for anyone to be talking about another discount (subsidy) post-refining is nothing short of a joke. We had dedicated an article to that effect: Examine fuel subsidy claims closely. (The relevant committees in the National Assembly have not done the necessary investigatory work on this vexed topic). So, well done Mr. President on the fuel subsidy matter. However, we strongly disagree with the idea of floating the naira at this time. Nigeria is a fledgling economy with absolutely noelastic forex earners at this time to permit of massive devaluations, or exposure of the national currency to the vagaries of market forces.(See Naira devaluation: a precipate step; and Naira cannot appreciate under market forces). As those articles made clear, currency speculators and rent-collectors would always be the only net-beneficiaries of currency devaluations in Nigeria’s present industrial status. Upon the heels of the 1986 Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), of which currency devaluation was a principal component, the real sector, meaning the manufacturing sector, steeply declined, while the financial services sector, primarily the Banks, bloated. That unfortunate trajectory continues to this day. A fledgling nation must necessarily jealously protect her currency. That remains our argument. Nigeria must first fully install the critical infrastructure for competitive industrial production before exposing her national currency to the vagaries of market forces.Therefore, floating the naira at this time is rather precipitate, our financial authorities are advised to urgently review that policy. The Ministry of Finance in general, and the Apex Bank in particular should undertake a comprehensive examination of the practices of commercial banks more so in relation to forex transactions.Lastly, notwithstanding the unfurling economic hardship across Nigeria, we are unwaveringly of one mind with those who think of Nigeria as a multi-trillion dollar economy in the near future. Nigeria has all the necessary components to make the ranking, but first, she must make the right choices and policies. • Godwin Afam Nkemdiche, an engineering consultant, resides in Abuja.

       "   'content': \"A Person who wants to walk in the light of God must do away with the deeds of darkness. 1 Peter 2:1 threw more light on what constitutes the deeds of darkness when it said: “Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.” Mark the phrase “rid yourselves.” The things that we are to rid ourselves of are the deeds of darkness. There is no way we will experience spiritual growth if we are still fumbling with the deeds of darkness. It is like climbing a mountain with heavy unwanted baggage. This is why John argued that if we say that we have fellowship with Him (God) and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth (1 John 1:6). A man who walks in the light has done away with the deeds of darkness. Such reflects the beauty or characteristics of Jesus as seen in the fruit of the spirit (Galatians 5:22) and such is the goal of a man who desires to grow in the spirit. It signifies spiritual maturity. Apostle Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews in Hebrews 5:12-14 expressed frustration when he told them that they have remained immature believers despite how long they have been in the faith. One of the sure ways of growing into spiritual maturity is diligent and regular study of God’s Word. But it does not end there. The individual studying the word must have a determination to live it out. It is by living out the word of God that a person can be said to be walking in the light. The Bible said in Matthew 55:16, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify God. Paul admonished Timothy to study (not just read) the scripture so that he will “rightly divide” the word. So, he must have what he is teaching at the tips of his fingers, or as GNB translation puts it, he should be one who correctly teaches the message of God’s truth” (2 Timothy 2:15). Romans 13:12, is a call to self-examination. It is a call to get rid of sin in your life so that you can walk in the light. Paul admonished us to cast away the works of darkness. To cast something away means to take it, to seize it, and to hurl it away. To cast something away, we have to grab it and reject it. It requires certain fierceness. We need God’s grace to be able to accomplish that in our lives. Darkness is real and spiritual darkness is worse. Darkness clouds our minds not to see the depths of our sinfulness and deadness as God sees them. Paul went further to tell us to put on the armour of light. Light causes darkness to flee. The Bible is clear about where darkness comes from. We live in darkness when we refuse to be governed by God. We live in darkness when we do not accept God’s authority over our lives. The practical duty for everyone who wants to walk in the light is to cast away the works of darkness and put on the armour of light. Whatever thing you find within which is akin to “darkness,” pluck it out and cast it away! • Today’s nugget: Put away the works of darkness. Prayer: Lord help me to do away with the works of the flesh. • Prayer lines: 08033299824. E-mail: amadiabelukachi@gmail.com. Rev. (Dr.) Abel Ukachi Amadi.

       "   'content': \"The Group Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd), Mele Kyari, has assured that with the increasing spate of investment in the oil and gas sector, issues of energy scarcity in the country would be over in the next 10 years. The NNPC boss disclosed that the completion of the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben Pipeline was in sight as the tunneling across the River Niger was currently ongoing. On the divestment of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) from onshore and shallow water assets, he said that its role is that of a facilitator, and not an obstacle. He explained that by virtue of its statutory mandate as the enabler of national energy security, NNPC Ltd.’s role is to ensure that, at the end of the day, there is optimal and sustainable production from the divested assets to guarantee energy security for the benefit of Nigerians. In a separate development, the company’s Executive Vice President, Upstream, Mrs. Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan, called for deeper collaboration among upstream operators, especially independent producers, to find solutions to the challenges hindering the effective development of divested assets in the nation’s oil and gas industry. Eyesan stated that past experiences with divestments and how the assets were operated have left much to be desired as most of them experienced a drop in production rather than growth. She, however, acknowledged that there were some success stories in the operations of the independent producers. She identified some of the challenges to include insecurity, lack of finance, and lack of technological capacity, stressing that with collaboration among industry players, the challenges could be surmounted.

       "   'content': \"Several hundred people rallied in the Senegalese capital Dakar on Saturday calling for the country’s postponed presidential elections to be held before April 2, the date when incumbent Macky Sall’s term is set to end. The protesters gathered at a sandy lot in a working-class neighbourhood for the protest, called by the “Resistance Front”, an alliance of opposition parties and campaigning groups. Many brandished Senegalese flags and portraits of the opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, jailed since July for “incitement to insurrection” and barred from running in the presidential vote. Sonko has endorsed Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who is also in jail but who was cleared to be on the ballot. The crowd shouted “Macky Sall dictator” and “Free Sonko”, singing a song in his praise. Several speakers representing some of the election candidates addressed the crowd, including former prime minister Aminata Toure, a member of the “Bassirou President” coalition. “What we are asking President Macky Sall is to organise these elections before April 2 and to give the keys to the palace to his successor face to face, so that we can begin to rebuild our country,” he said. The West African country was thrown into a political crisis on February 3 when Sall postponed the presidential election planned for February 25. His announcement, denounced as a “constitutional coup d’etat” by the opposition, sparked huge protests that resulted in four deaths. On February 15, the constitutional council overruled Sall, and ever since the country has been waiting for a new date. “We want an election before the 2nd (of April) with the 19 candidates retained by the Constitutional Council and for Senegalese democracy to continue to shine,” said one demonstrator, 27-year-old trader Assane Camara. A national dialogue, organised at the start of the week by the president but boycotted by the opposition, had recommended holding the elections on June 2. Sall indicated that he would ask the constitutional council for its opinion on the request. Saturday’s rally, approved by the authorities, ended in confusion following what appeared to be scuffles between supporters of rival candidates for the presidency, Sonko and Khalifa Sall, former mayor of Dakar (no relation to the president). Supporters of the outgoing president have called for a “march for peace” Sunday morning in the capital Dakar. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"The leaders of the Southeast chapter of the People’s Democratic Party has called for the suspension and prosecution of Ali Odefa, the National Vice Chairman for the South-East. The chapter accused Odefa of “criminal subversion of the PDP Constitution”. “The recent events surrounding the misleading and disreputable meeting of the South-East Zonal Executive Committee, orchestrated by Chief Ali Odefa, regarding the status of Senator Samuel Anyanwu as the National Secretary of the PDP, have brought significant embarrassment not only to our party but also to the entire South-East region,” said the spokesman of the chapter Michael Ohakwe in a statement on Saturday. Ohakwe said it was regrettable that a high-ranking national officer of the party resorted to “misquoting and misrepresenting the PDP Constitution and Electoral Guidelines through national media channels solely to further his own selfish agenda.” “We assert that Chief Odefa lacks the moral character and integrity necessary to effectively represent the interests of the South-East in his current position. Therefore, we demand immediate disciplinary action be taken against him, as well as any other party leaders involved in this egregious act, in order to serve as a deterrent against similar misconduct in the future. “We wish to reaffirm our unwavering confidence in the leadership of Senator Samuel Anyanwu as the authentic National Secretary of the PDP. His commitment to the party’s values and principles remains steadfast, and we stand firmly behind him. “In light of the gravity of Chief Odefa’s actions and their detrimental impact on our party and our region, we implore the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP to swiftly suspend him pending further investigation and legal proceedings.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"The Federal Government, on Saturday, says train services on Port Harcourt to Aba route will start operation by the end of March. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Port Harcourt-Aba rail project is part of the larger Port Harcourt-Maiduguri railroad project initiated by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Mr Fidet Okhiria, Managing Director, Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) disclosed this in Port Harcourt after leading a delegation to test-run the reconstructed of Eastern Narrow Guage Rail line. He said workers were currently putting finishing touches on the tracks to ensure that full train operation could begin within the month. “I am impressed with what I saw today, especially being able to ride the locomotive and wagon on the tracks. “Last time we visited, we could not use the train because the contractor said it was not proper to run on the train due to imbalance of the tracks. “The Minister of Transportation, Mu’azu Sambo, has directed that the Port Harcourt route be connected to rail as well as initiate the linkage of Onne Port,” he said. Okhiria expressed confidence that the contractor would complete the ‘tampering’ of the railroad within two weeks, preceding the targeted three weeks for the train services to resume. “We are pushing the contractor to make the track safe by deploying semi-automatic signalling of the machine points rather than manual operation. “Despite resource challenges, the contractors are doing their best, and our goal is to achieve this within the next two weeks. “With this, we aim to commence passenger train services hopefully within March and fully resume transporting people from Port Harcourt to Aba by the end of March,” he assured. The managing director said the project design team had started designing a rail track to connect the Port Harcourt-Aba railroad line to the Onne sea port. He stated that NRC had begun collaborating with the port’s terminal manager and leading engineers to ensure a smooth project delivery. “The initial design has been done and handed over to us. We look at it, make corrections and seek approval. Once approved, work will commence,” he added. Regarding transport fares, Okhiria mentioned that due to the current high cost of diesel, commuters might have to pay higher fares than what was obtainable before. He said if NRC could not cover 100 per cent fuel cost, the corporation would aim to generate at least 50 per cent from passengers to sustain operations. “Additionally, we will assess the conditions of the roads with intent to cover at least 50 per cent of the road costs. “The government is working with relevant security agencies to ensure adequate security of the rain line, and the linkage of security devices from the trains to the control room. “Communities should protect what the government is putting in place for us. We are striving to ensure that people who come on the train are safe,” he said. Okhiria cautioned traders against conducting business on the rail lines, as the trains would no longer slow down for them to remove their goods before passing. He said that the trains were scheduled to run according to fixed times across all railroads in the country. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"Days before the biggest night of the presidential primary season, a new poll published Saturday will ring alarm bells for Joe Biden, who is seen lagging behind his likely White House challenger Donald Trump. The nationwide survey of registered voters by the New York Times and Siena College found that if the election were held today, 48 percent would choose Trump with 43 percent for Biden. The poll comes just ahead of “Super Tuesday” — when more than a dozen US states hold presidential nominating contests in an exercise expected to finally end the challenge of Trump’s remaining Republican rival, Nikki Haley. The survey found President Biden struggling, despite many positive economic indicators, to persuade ordinary Americans that his policies are working for them. Only one in four said the country is moving in the right direction, and more than twice as many voters said Biden’s policies had hurt rather than helped them. Significantly, the poll found waning support for Biden among some normally reliable Democratic constituencies, including blue-collar workers and non-white voters. And while Trump has unified his base to a remarkable extent — 97 percent of those who voted for him in 2020 said they would do so again — only 83 percent of Biden’s 2020 voters vowed to stick with him and a full 10 percent now back Trump. The Times/Siena poll also noted a dramatic decline in Biden’s support among less educated working-class voters of color. Four years ago, Biden won that demographic by 50 points but the poll suggested the margin over Trump had since plummeted to just six points. Much can happen in the months before the November 5 election, and Trump is still battling four indictments and 91 felony counts, though his core supporters appear to shrug those off. And while Super Tuesday should see the end of Haley’s challenge, analysts say Trump’s dominant primary showing hides stiff opposition to his candidacy among the moderate Republicans and independents he needs to defeat Biden. Nor is it clear how many skeptical Biden voters might grit their teeth and support him again rather than see Trump return to office. The poll of 980 registered voters had a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 points. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?
