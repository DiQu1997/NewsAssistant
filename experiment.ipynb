       "   'content': \"Following its initial announcement in January, businesses across Africa can now use Google’s Gemini AI-powered chat-like tool for Search Ads. This intuitive tool is now fully operational and designed to help businesses in Africa and across the world boost their online visibility. Google, which disclosed this yesterday, said in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, where Internet penetration is rapidly increasing, the ability to effectively reach customers through online advertising is becoming increasingly crucial for business growth. Google said its conversational experience takes the complexity out of ad creation, empowering businesses of any size to easily craft campaigns that resonate with local audiences. VP and GM of Search Ads & Ads on Google Experiences, Shashi Thakur, said: “Creating effective ads can be time-consuming, especially for small businesses. Our new conversational experience helps businesses of all sizes tap into the power of Google AI to create successful Search campaigns with remarkable ease.” On how the conversational experience, Google said: “Easy to Get Started: Simply provide a website address, and Google AI will automatically analyse the content. “Tailored Suggestions: The AI generates relevant keywords, ad headlines, and descriptions, inspired by a business and its target region. “Visual Inspiration: Need ad images? Google AI pulls visuals from a website or creates new ones. “You’re Still in Control: Advertisers review and approve all AI-generated elements, ensuring ads reflect their brand.” Google said the introduction of this conversational experience has led to tangible benefits for businesses utilising the platform, with businesses using the conversational experience in Google Ads being 42 per cent more likely to publish Search campaigns with ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ Ad Strength. This strong ad quality has been shown to directly increase conversions. The American firm said this development is part of Google’s broader initiative to empower small businesses in Africa and globally, by facilitating the creation of impactful Search ads. It said by automatically generating headlines and descriptions based on existing website content, Google’s AI enables ads to dynamically respond to relevant searches. This adaptive approach ensures that small businesses can effectively capture the attention of potential customers, enhancing their visibility in search results.

According to Bloomberg, one option being considered is for SoftBank to raise $70 billion from Middle East financial institutions and inject $30 billion itself. Sources told Bloomberg details of the venture are being worked out and could change. Bloomberg wrote the project is codenamed Izanagi, the Japanese god of creation and life. The venture would compete directly with Nvidia, a key supplier of high-end chips for AI workloads running in data centres. SoftBank returned to profit for the first time in five quarters in its fiscal Q3 2023 (which ran to end-December 2023), with its net asset value rising after Arm boosted its full-year revenue guidance, lifting its share price. The company owns 90 per cent of Arm. SoftBank CFO Yoshimitsu Goto said on an earnings call there is strong demand for its AI chip designs. You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"The about 43 companies licensed by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to provide Mobile Virtual Network Operations (MVNO) in Nigeria have been advised not to focus only on voice and data services for revenue generation, but also develop niche operations. These were parts of the fallout from an MVNO conference organised by Wireless Technology Labs (WTL) in Lagos. According to experts, who spoke at the forum, MVNO licensees would need to offer an array of value-added services (VAS) that are not being offered currently by the mobile network operators (MNOs). According to them, many Nigerians are already subscribed to voice and data services from the MNOs and may not want to change to MVNOs for the same services. Based on the MVNOs architecture, they are expected to start rolling out their services anytime soon and would ride on the existing infrastructure of MNOs. An MVNO is a telecommunications product and service operator that rides on top of the infrastructure capacity of a fully-licensed mobile telecommunication service provider or MNOs. This means that the operators will not need investments in their infrastructure but leverage existing facilities across the country to provide services. Speaking during the conference, the Chief Executive Officer of WTL, Satya Mekala, said MVNOs in other climes became profitable by offering VAS and not from data or voice services. He noted that MVNOs have the advantage of offering services in several areas of the economy, including education, agriculture, and rural development, among others. “What MVNOs do is that they look at a particular problem in a particular market, for instance in education or agriculture or remote rural areas. They look at it as a business opportunity and provide solutions and they make money. “Mobile operators are not doing that because they have become very big and very rich and making a lot of money. The MVNOs can only make a small amount of money from voice but they can make a lot of money from VAS,” he said. Corroborating Mekala, the Vice President, TecnoTree of Himmat Gill, said MVNOs could only survive through market differentiation. “Market differentiation can serve as a potent strategy for MVNOs to overcome the challenges of low revenue and competition from the MNOs. By distinguishing themselves from competitors, MVNOs can attract and retain customers,” he said. On his part, the CEO, Portaone, Andriy Zhylenko, listed three areas and seven specific steps that can aid MVNO licensees in service delivery. According to him, these three areas are that they need to find a customer segment; provide a better customer experience and maximize profits. Further, he said operators must have a unique business plan; offer solutions for growth (not just data and minutes); bundle third-party services; use in-house low code automation; implement an agile network; customer empowerment through self-care and harvest IoT market growth. Already, from Fortune Business Insights, the global MVNO market size is projected to rise from $67.54 billion in 2020 to $123.40 billion in 2028, at a CAGR of 7.9 per cent during the forecast period, 2021-2028. As of June 2014, 943 MVNOs and 255 MNO sub-brands were active worldwide. This represents a total of almost 1,200 mobile service providers worldwide hosted by MNOs, up from 1, 036 in 2012.

       "   'content': \"The Lagos State government has reiterated the need to harness opportunities within the climate change ecosystem to institutionalise a circular economy to create jobs and contribute to the state’s gross domestic product (GDP). Speaking during a courtesy call on the management of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), the Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Climate Change and Circular Economy, Titi Oshodi, said climate change poses a severe threat to the well-being and economy of Lagos state. Oshodi said the energy sector in the state is the highest contributor to the emission of greenhouse gas in the state, “so, fundamentally, the ministry is the first port of call”. The state’s Climate Action Plan between 2020 and 2025 showed that more than half of Lagos’s 21 million residents live in informal settlements, which makes them vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, she said. She noted that the state’s Adaptation and Resilience Plan (LCARP) estimated the effects of climate inaction at $22 to $29 billion, 11 times the state’s 2022 yearly budget. She said the state must look for ways to rein in the menace, hence “we are first touching base with major actors and sharing our plans with them”. “We plan to bridge that gap using various advocacy platforms and education channels that we are creating. We are ready to work with all stakeholders to ease their work and accelerate their impact through climate change education and advocacy. “On the other hand, climate change and its impact are not all bad news. They also hold huge economic opportunities for job creation and revenue generation,” she said. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'description': 'Some owners say they may have to leave their pets behind after a major travel firm raised its prices.',\n",
       "   'content': 'IAG Cargo, which handles pet transfers for some major airlines, is raising prices from 1 March on select routes. Sara, whose military family is moving back to the US from the UK, saw the price to ship her two small dogs Ghost and Bentley jump from £1,143 to £5,118. IAG Cargo said the higher prices reflect the complexity of the service. A sister company to British Airways, Aer Lingus and Vueling, IAG Cargo is seen as a key provider when it comes to transferring pets, particularly between the US and UK. The price changes apply to anyone using IAG Cargo to move their animals on certain routes. The shipping firm is often used by military personnel to take their pets abroad when their role is relocated. Sara\\'s military family is moving back to the US after three years at their duty station in the UK. They are due to ship Bentley and Ghost on a British Airways flight on 1 March. Under its current policy, IAG Cargo will only accept a booking for a pet transfer up to six weeks before the flight - it then confirms the space has been requested and \"pencilled in\". About two weeks before, once the planes have been scheduled on that route, the booking is confirmed and the price is locked in. Sara had initially received a quote for the journey from London to Baltimore at £1,143 for both dogs. But the price has now jumped to £5,118, without administration fees or those for the agency she is using to arrange the cargo shipment. When Sara saw an email with the updated price from her pet shipper on Sunday, she says her eyes filled with tears. \"We\\'re paying out of our own pocket for this, and we just bought a house in our new location,\" she said. \"Our dogs are like our children, we would do anything for them but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not devastating for our finances.\" Sara\\'s shipping agent found another airline which could transfer their pets for a lower price. But it means a seven-hour round trip to collect them from a different airport. She added that while her dogs are smaller breeds, she believes other larger pets could see shipment costs reaching £8,000 to £9,000. \"I already know a number of people who did not bring their pets [to the UK] because of the costs to bring them one way... People are going to be shocked.\" Currently, for one cat or dog\\'s transfer if personnel are moving between countries. UK Defence does not pay for any pet transport costs. Dean Faulkner, director of Silver Birch Pet Jets, helps US and UK military families move their pets for permanent station changes. He said some ticket prices had gone up by as much as 400%. He said many military families would be in \"turmoil as they will not be able to confirm the funds\". Mr Faulkner said he heard of the price changes on Friday and had spent the last few days trying to comfort families or find alternative routes. \"Often young families will have small children and pets and get three months\\' notice when restarting their whole lives from scratch,\" he said. \"It\\'s a huge amount to organise, and within days or weeks of arriving one of those family members may be sent on to areas of conflict. The dog or cat is hugely important, it is the family\\'s companion when one partner is away fighting and this will be hugely distressing for them. \"It\\'s massively emotional and detrimental to their health and welfare.\" Having been in the industry for 12 years, Mr Faulkner said that such price increases were \"unheard of\" and \"came without warning\". \"Even during Covid, when aircraft were flying without passengers, prices were not going up as much,\" he added. Stephanie, a UK national and military spouse will soon be returning from Florida with her children as her relationship has come to an end. She said she had originally been quoted $2,600 to ship her dog Toby to London with IAG in June, with the cost totalling some $5,000 to $6,000 when fees and shipping agent costs were added. Stephanie is now terrified she could potentially be facing a \"completely unreachable\" bill of up to $20,000 with the price increases by IAG Cargo, which she says would leave her in debt. \"I\\'d have to consider leaving Toby which would destroy my kids. Some people have dogs and some people have family members, the idea of leaving him behind is something I don\\'t even want to think about,\" she told the BBC. \"For people like me, and those in the military who have to pick up and leave everything behind, it\\'s extremely difficult... keeping families together could become unattainable.\" The BBC has also received emails from families who said they \"simply cannot afford\" the price increases ahead of their move to the United States in April on military orders. Another couple returning to the US due to a permanent station change said the cost of shipping their three-year-old cat would be \"exorbitant\", adding to the financial strain they already face. They urged IAG Cargo to \"reconsider\" and \"support military families\". Maria Lyle, director of the Royal Air Force (RAF) Families Federation, said: \"It sounds like a really difficult situation for those families returning in the short-term with little notice of the change.\" She said as the RAF had hundreds of families serving in the US, the charity would raise the question with the British Embassy in Washington. IAG Cargo said it had reviewed pet transfer rates across its global portfolio and \"adjusted a number of rates across multiple routes to better reflect the complexities and care associated with this product.\" A spokesperson for the firm said: \"We know that pets are as important as family members and the specialist service of providing safe and secure transport for live animals is our priority. \"To reflect the complexities of this bespoke service and the cost of providing the very best care for pets travelling as cargo, we have made some amendments to our prices.\" They encouraged any customers with questions about their quotes to contact their sales representative.',\n",

The dating app has been repeatedly targeted by fraudsters. The charity Victim Support said the move was welcome but added platforms like Tinder needed to \"go further\". \"Ensuring ID verification is mandatory across all dating apps, rather than optional, would be more robust,\" charity spokesman Wayne Stevens told the BBC. \"Romance fraud is a devastating crime, particularly because of the shame and stigma around it.\" The fraud - also known as catfishing - involves a person entering a relationship while pretending to be someone else. Their goal can be to deceive someone into a romantic relationship, often with the aim of scamming money from them. There have been to combat the practice. Tinder says the system it is introducing should give users more confidence that the people they meet on the app are who they say they are. It will see users who verify a photo receiving a blue camera icon badge, and those who prove their ID is authentic getting a blue ID icon badge. Anyone who completes both steps will be given a blue checkmark. The system was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in 2023. The firm says those who chose to be verified in these countries were far more likely to get a match - with a 67% increase in matches compared with unverified users. Along with the UK, the tool is also being brought in for people based in the US, Brazil and Mexico.

       "   'content': 'Closures will begin immediately on Tuesday, according to the firm that is overseeing the restructuring of the retailer. The Body Shop employs around 2,200 people in the UK, including 750 staff at its head office. The cuts would \"help re-energise\" the brand, the administrators said. The stores immediately affected include four in London, where rents and other overheads are highest. Others closing on Tuesday are in Nuneaton, Ashford and Bristol. The chain\\'s remaining shops and the website will trade as normal as the restructuring proceeds. The UK arm of The Body Shop was put into administration last week, a couple of months after it was bought up by Aurelius, a German private equity firm. FRP Advisory, the administrator for The Body Shop, said on Tuesday: \"A reduced store footprint, will coincide with a renewed focus on the brand\\'s products, online sales channels and wholesale strategies.\" Staff headcount at the head office in London will be reduced by approximately 40%, FRP said, as part of a \"more nimble, financially viable model\" following the earlier sale of loss-making businesses in mainland Europe and parts of Asia. Aurelius bought The Body Shop for £207m at the end of last year from Brazilian beauty giant Natura. But the private equity firm said the chain\\'s performance over the festive period was \"worse than [their] worst-case assumptions\", prompting the move to call in administrators. It is the first major retail failure this year in the UK. Aurelius is The Body Shop\\'s main secured creditor - meaning it is first in line to receive payments from the company as it is restructured. As a result, Aurelius is also considered to be in pole position to take back control of the retailer. The Body Shop was founded by the pioneering British businesswoman and activist Dame Anita Roddick and her husband in 1976, and quickly established itself as a ground breaking ethical, sustainable brand - rejecting animal testing on cosmetics, and promoting environmentally-friendly products and ethical sourcing practices. However, since then it has faced increasing competition, in particular from High Street rival Lush which was co-founded by Mark Constantine who used to be a supplier to The Body Shop. In 2006, Dame Anita and her husband sold The Body Shop to French beauty giant L\\'Oreal, which some of its original customer base viewed as a sell-out. Later its adoption of aggressive sales tactics, including ferocious discounting, put people off paying full prices for its products.',\n",

It means that in practical effect Labour\\'s position is now much closer to the SNP\\'s - although Labour\\'s amendment emphasises more than the SNP\\'s the role of Hamas as well as Israel in bringing about a lasting ceasefire. A party spokesperson said: \"Our amendment calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, in line with our allies. \"We need the hostages released and returned. We need the fighting to stop now. We need a massive humanitarian aid programme for Gaza. And any military action in Rafah cannot go ahead. \"We want the fighting to stop now. We also have to be clear on how we prevent the violence starting up again. There will be no lasting peace without a diplomatic process that delivers a two-state solution, with a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state.\"',\n",

       "   'content': 'Ex-Post Office chair Henry Staunton to sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Badenoch has denied the claims, calling them \"completely false\", but he continues to stand by them. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\\'s Farming Today, Rishi Sunak said Ms Badenoch had \"made a fulsome statement\". The PM was asked whether he could categorically deny Mr Staunton\\'s claim that a senior civil servant had told him to \"stall\" on compensation payments, to allow the government to \"limp into the election\", apparently to help state finances. He did not answer the question directly, but insisted that the business secretary gave a \"very clear explanation\". \"Kemi made a fulsome statement about this in Parliament,\" he responded. \"She was right to do so and gave, I think, a very clear explanation of everything that\\'s happened.\" Hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted because of glitches in the Horizon IT system between 1999 and 2015 in what has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history. The government has promised to quash convictions and pay compensation, but concerns have been raised over the speed and complexity in victims securing financial redress, with just 33 claims fully settled. The row between Ms Badenoch and Mr Staunton started when that Ms Badenoch had said \"someone\\'s got to take the rap\" during his sacking last month, and that a senior civil servant had instructed the rate of payments to be slowed. But, speaking in Parliament on Monday, Ms Badenoch furiously rejected the claims, which she labelled \"a blatant attempt to seek revenge following dismissal\", adding Mr Staunton should provide evidence. In response, a statement from Mr Staunton stated that he stood by the comment and that he had \"recorded at the time in a file note which he emailed to himself and to colleagues and which is therefore traceable on the Post Office server\". The statement added: \"Mr Staunton is not in the habit of resorting to fabrication or invention and decided to go public out of a desire to ensure that the public were fully aware of the facts surrounding the multiple failures that have led to postmasters in this country being badly let down.\" The prime minister was speaking to Radio 4\\'s Farming Today in an exclusive interview, which will be .',\n",

       "   'description': 'Blackpool South MP Scott Benton loses an appeal against a recommended 35-day suspension.',\n",
       "   'content': 'MPs will now vote whether to trigger a recall petition which could force a by-election. Mr Benton was caught breaching Commons rules by offering to lobby ministers and table parliamentary questions on behalf of gambling investors. He was elected as a Conservative in 2019 with a 3,690 majority. The MP, who now sits as an independent, , but a report by an independent panel has upheld the Standards Committee\\'s original decision, saying there had been \"no procedural flaw\" in the process. The panel also described Mr Benton\\'s arguments as \"misconceived or erroneous\", finding the sanction was \"neither unreasonable nor disproportionate\". The finding means MPs will vote on whether to implement the recommended suspension which, if supported, would trigger a recall petition and a potential by-election in Mr Benton\\'s seat. It raises the prospect of another challenging poll for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after losses in Wellingborough and Kingswood last week. Voters will have six weeks to register their support for Mr Benton\\'s removal - 10% is the threshold needed to trigger a by-election. Labour has urged Mr Benton to resign as an MP completely. Jonathan Ashworth, shadow paymaster general, said: \"Scott Benton should do the decent thing and resign, saving the people of Blackpool South a lengthy recall petition that would leave them without the representation they deserve. \"This is yet another by-election caused by Tory scandal. Britain deserves better than this carousel of Conservative chaos.\" A Conservative seat from 1945 until 1997, the Blackpool South went red between 1997 and 2019. Scott Benton then snatched the seaside seat from long-serving Labour MP Gordon Marsden. But now it\\'s up for grabs again - with a majority of 3,690. Given recent by-election results in less favourable conditions for the Labour Party, they must fancy their chances if and when one is called here. The path to power for Labour at the next general election could be through winning back seats like these, so the party will mount a strong campaign, with its candidate Chris Webb already primed. Residents here have been hit by the long-term decline of seaside towns, and many in 2019 were enthused by Boris Johnson\\'s Levelling Up policies and the hope that his government could help turn the tide. Now Rishi Sunak could faces a strong electoral test in an archetypal Blue Wall seat - and it might be tougher than a stick of rock. northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk',\n",

       "   'content': \"Many Nigerians who are 37 years, four months and two days old today may not know anything about Dele Giwa, except they are diggers into history or they are children of curiosity. Dele Giwa was the founding Editor in Chief of Newswatch, who was assassinated by the use of a parcel bomb that was sent to him on Sunday, October 19, 1986. The parcel bore the inscription “From the Commander in Chief” and since he had received several parcels labelled like that from the then Commander in Chief, General Ibrahim Babangida, he had no hesitation in opening it. As he tried to open it, the parcel exploded and by the time he was rushed to the hospital, he was dead, stone dead. The London Correspondent of Newswatch who was visiting Nigeria at the time, was having lunch with Dele in his study. The bomb threw him on the floor and he lost his hearing for one year. We the co-founders of Newswatch, Yakubu Mohammed, Dan Agbese and Ray Ekpu as well as our lawyer, the irrepressible Gani Fawehinmi, did everything we could to bring the suspects who were government officials to justice but we were blocked, harassed and intimidated in several ways. The government also intimidated newspapers that carried in every issue of their newspaper the intimidating cry “Who killed Dele Giwa?” However, let us tell the story from the beginning. When Newswatch was born in January 1985 it stepped out as the purveyor of investigative journalism, as a truth-telling organ. After Mamman Vatsa and a group of other soldiers were killed in early 1986 for alleged coup plotting, Newswatch was accused of planning to publish the full verdict of the secret military tribunal that tried Vatsa and co. Dele was invited by the military intelligence for what was euphemistically called a ‘chat.’ Nothing happened but an invitation by a military intelligence outfit is a not-so-subtle form of intimidation. Next, the government accused Newswatch of planning to publish a cover story on the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), an organisation into which President Babangida had controversially dragged Nigeria. Many Nigerians were opposed to the attempt by the government to desecrate the country’s secularity and non-commitment into any partisan religious camp. The Inspector General of police (IGP), Etim Inyang, invited Dele to the police headquarters for a chat, that dangerous four-letter word that is the messenger of danger. I accompanied him. We took a copy of Newswatch that was to be on sale the next day to show the IGP. He read through the cover story on the OIC and found nothing that would affect the country’s interest. No detention. We went home at midnight. Next, Dele had written a column on the newly created Second-tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM). In that article, Dele had said that the ruling class had a responsibility to make SFEM a success, otherwise they would be stoned in the streets. Dele was invited by the State Security Service (SSS). I accompanied him. When we got there, he was asked to see one Col. A.K. Togun who was the Deputy Director of the SSS. Togun discussed with him and concluded that there was nothing untoward about the article since he had said in the article that he was sure that the President was determined to make SFEM work. Next, the clincher. On October 16, 1986, three days before his assassination, Dele was invited by the SSS to their headquarters at 15, Awolowo Road, Ikoyi. I accompanied him. When we got there, Dele was ushered into Togun’s office while I waited in the outer office. When Dele came out there were worry lines on his face. I knew that the handshake had gone beyond the elbow. Dele told me that Togun had peppered him with four allegations. One, that Newswatch was planning what he called the ‘other side’ of the Ukiwe story. Ebitu Ukiwe was the Chief of General Staff to Babangida until he was removed in circumstances that were unclear to the public. Newswatch had published a cover story titled “Power Games: Ukiwe loses out” in our October 20 issue of the magazine, which was on sale from October 13, 1986. Secondly, Togun alleged that Dele had promised to defend Alozie Ogugbuaja, the police superintendent who was suspended following his testimony before the Akanbi panel probing the students’ riot that took place a few months earlier. Dele was alleged to have promised to give the police officer a job in Newswatch if he was fired. Dele Giwa The third and fourth allegations were more grievous: that Dele was holding discussions with the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and students for the purpose of bringing about a socialist revolution and that in pursuance of that goal, he was planning to import arms into the country. Togun did not substantiate his wild and dangerous allegations because they were all cooked up, they were all lies and lies are not substantiatable. The only truth in the four allegations was the one about Ogugbuaja. Dele and I had spoken on the phone about him. We said that he was a courageous and brilliant journalist and that if the police sacked him, we would be happy to employ him. Look at it this way, “why would the government bother about who employs someone it didn’t want to continue as its staff.” Since Dele and I discussed this Ogugbuaja matter on the phone, it was clear to us that our NITEL phones were being bugged. NITEL was the only company offering phone services at that time. I brought a security expert who removed several bugging devices from my residence. We also discovered that we had employed a man who was working for the SSS. He did not disclose this in his curriculum vitae. We had to fire him. This may sound like a horror movie done by an intrepidly creative writer but that was journalism in Nigeria and Nigeria in journalism. That is why several journalists have been needlessly killed over the years for doing their duty. That weekend of the interrogation, Dele reported the matter to Augustus Aikhomu, Vice President and Prince Tony Momoh, Minister of Information in the presence of other journalists. Momoh dismissed it as a joke and said “They just want to rattle you.” Giwa and I went to report the matter to our lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, after the ‘chat’ with the SSS. He asked Dele to write a report of it for him. Dele did it the same day. On Saturday, October 18, 1986, someone from the Directorate of Military Intelligence kept calling Dele’s residence but didn’t get to speak to him because Dele was not at home. Eventually, Halilu Akilu, the Director of the Department of Military Intelligence, called Dele’s residence and spoke to Dele’s wife, Funmi. He asked Funmi for the address and description of the area because as he put it “I am not familiar with Ikeja.” Funmi described for him how he could get to the house. Then Funmi asked out of curiosity why Akilu was asking for the home address of her husband. Akilu replied “The ADC has something for him, an invitation or something like that.” On Sunday, October 19, Dele decided to find out why Akilu was persistently calling his house the day before. Akilu said he called him to tell him that he should not worry about the SSS allegations. Giwa said “I will worry. It is an attempt to ruin my name. I have already written to my lawyer about it.” Akilu replied: “Dele, this is not a matter for lawyers. Don’t bother yourself. The matter is now settled.” Forty minutes later the bomb arrived, wrapped in an envelope with the imprimatur of the Commander in Chief. Since then, we have fought many battles to get justice for Dele. Fawehinmi asked the Attorney General of Lagos State to prosecute Akilu and Togun. No luck. Fawehinmi got the approval of the Supreme Court to act as a private prosecutor. The security forces harassed him endlessly, sometimes sending helicopters to hover over his office. Newswatch was proscribed six months after Dele’s death so that we would not continue the pursuit of justice for Dele. We were detained and our accounts and those of the company frozen. We appeared with Fawehinmi at the Oputa Panel set up by the President Olusegun Obasanjo government in 2001. Babangida, Akilu and Togun got a court injunction to prevent the panel from inviting them to appear at the panel. We, Dele’s colleagues made presentation at the Oputa Panel in Lagos and Abuja. In its report, the panel said “As for the case of Dele Giwa, we are of the view that beyond the legal technicalities that some of the key witnesses clung to, the Federal Government should be encouraged to reopen this case for proper investigation.” It stated further “On General Ibrahim Babangida we are of the view that there is evidence to suggest that he and the two security chiefs, Brigadier General Halilu Akilu and Col. A.K. Togun, are accountable for the death of Dele Giwa by letter bomb. We recommend that this case be reopened for further investigation in the public interest.” Since then, nothing has been done by the authorities. Neither the government of President Umaru Yar’Adua nor that of President Goodluck Jonathan nor that of President Muhammadu Buhari had bothered to do anything about the matter. In this matter, all the relevant documents are available: Fawehinmi’s presentation, Newswatch Directors’ submission and the report of the Investigating Police Officer, Abubakar Tsav. None of the past governments looked in the direction of reopening this matter. Now, another legal entity has reopened the matter in a case brought by the Incorporated Trustees of the Media Rights Agenda. On February 16, 2024, a Federal High Court in Abuja, under Justice Inyang Ekwo, has asked the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) to prosecute and penalise the killers of Dele Giwa because the assassination of Dele violates his right to life under the Nigerian Constitution and the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights. So it is meet and proper to say that Dele Giwa is dead. Dele Giwa is not dead. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"Despite the ongoing legal tussle against the dissolution of State Working Committee (SWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, political gladiators are already scheming to outsmart one another in the titanic battle that will make or mar the future of the party in Rivers, ANN GODWIN reports. The battle for the soul of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers States has renewed political rivalry among former governors, Rotimi Amaechi, Nyesom Wike and Senator Magnus Abe. Ironically, the troika cut their political teeth in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). But with time, three of them climbed high on the political ladder, with two becoming chief executives of the state at different times, while the third ended up as a Senator with eyes on the governorship seat. Some residents of the state refer to them as three musketeers. Following political developments in the state ahead of the 2023 general elections, Wike as the sitting PDP governor led the G-5 governors to campaign for the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as the President and the inability of Rivers APC to win the governorship election, there are new political realignment that have subdued APC structure in the state. Many analysts saw the state exco led by Emeka Beke as a weakling that could no longer provide effective leadership for the party given the influx of political gladiators dumping their parties for the APC. Beke and his other exco members are believed to be loyalists of Amaechi, who has been on the wrong side of the party after the presidential election. Amaechi, one of APC’s founding fathers, resigned from former President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet to contest for the party’s presidential ticket with Tinubu and others. But after losing the primary, Amaechi developed cold feet towards the presidential campaign that produced Tinubu, leaving Wike to lead the presidential campaign in the state. Amaechi deployed his efforts and resources for the party to win other elections in the state, which did not produce the desired results. Despite the perceived cold war between Amaechi and the national leadership of the party and the president, Beke had on August 26, 2023, led some leaders of the party in the state, including the governorship candidate of the party in the last election, Tonye Cole and Dr Dakuku Peterside to visit Abdulahi Ganduje, who was confirmed as the national chairman of the party on August 3, 2023, by the NEC of the party. Wike However, that did not stop the national leadership of APC from dissolving Beke-led exco on November 24, 2023, and replacing it with a seven-man caretaker committee led by Tony Okocha believed to be an ally of Wike. The national spokesperson of the party, Felix Morka, said the caretaker committee would be in office for six months to conduct a comprehensive and fresh electronic party registration for all members of the state. He said: “The caretaker committee, subject to the directives of the NWC, was entrusted with preparing for the conduct of congresses to facilitate the emergence of new executive committees for the party at various levels, extending from the ward to the state.” But the Publicity Secretary of the dissolved exco, Darlington Nwauju, said there was no justification for dissolving the exco because there was no crisis in the party. He said: “There was no reason at all for dissolving the party executives in the state. When you talk about crises and people’s management, remember that we came to visit him (Ganduje); he didn’t invite us. So, after that visit, if there were issues that he felt we should sort out and he wanted to help us resolve, why were we not invited? Why were we not part of the process that led to this final decision on dissolution? “You can see that the party was not carried along; the decision was taken to wipe off the entire validly elected structure. Will you now face the 1,421 delegates who voted for me across the 219 wards in River State that you had set aside their votes? “The man whom Ganduje announced as the chairman of the caretaker committee refused to revalidate his membership in the party. So, his name is not on the party’s register at the national secretariat. Your announcing such a person as chairman of a caretaker committee shows that the party lacks institutional memory. Telling us you have dissolved validly elected executives of the party is not just an insult to our sensibility as human beings but an affront to the constitution of the APC, to which we all subscribe. If you look at what it entails to be a member of the APC as stated in Article 9, there is a specific tenure for the executive, and it is within the jurisdiction of the NWC to dissolve but not that of the NEC.” Not satisfied with the development and the manner the national leadership hijacked the party structure from them, the Beke-led state exco has approached an Abuja High Court and a Port Harcourt High Court to challenge the dissolution and request the courts to interpret the constitution of the APC. Even when the powers that be in Abuja favour Wike to control the APC structure in the state, the Minister of FCT is still a bona fide member of the PDP. Although many have argued that most of his political foot soldiers have decamped to the APC. Indeed, 27 state lawmakers loyal to him had in December last year officially switched their allegiance to the APC. They cited an internal crisis within the PDP for their action. Political analysts have expressed concerns about how the three gladiators with their egos and ambitions would stay under one party without further bickering. Amaechi has not spoken about the dissolution of the exco loyal to him, creating suspense among party members. Abe is yet to inform the public if he has buried his governorship ambition, which Wike and Amaechi may not support. While Abe was defecting to the APC, he said he was doing so to support the government of President Bola Tinubu and ensure that Rivers people benefit from the development at the centre. Magnus Abe Abe said: “My coming to APC is to work together with other members of the party to ensure grow th, inclusion, prosperity and progress for Rivers State and Rivers people. If we all have the same mind, we will achieve the objective,” acknowledging that: “We are very strong characters, none of the people in the party is a walk over but if we can all agree and come together, there’s no other force again in Rivers that can stop us. We are the ones who always stop each other, so I believe that if we can find common ground, which we have found in the APC, there will be peace for everyone. “By now, everybody who is part of APC should have learnt something, it is time to see how we can make the party work, we are coming back with open minds and we are ready to work with everybody within the party, I believe that everybody who is sincerely interested in the progress of APC will be ready to work together.” Responding to the news of Abe’s return to APC, Okocha said, Abe was one of the founding members of APC but left to pursue an ambition, which brought him to the end of the road. He assured that the party welcomes him back and would work together with him However, Wike’s open rift with Governor Siminalayi Fubara and his romance with APC have opened another window for realignment with some PDP forces that had fallen apart with the Minister. The likes of Abiye Sekibo, Evans Bipi, Austin Opara, Celestine Omehia and even former governor, Dr Peter Odili’s are pitching tents with Fubara to rebuild the party. Speaking on the current alignment and realignment, a Research/Development and Policy Expert, Sunny Dada, said, “The status of Wike right now is a political leprosy, there are serious Iroko trees waiting for him in APC and also in PDP. The people who are angry with him are just waiting for him in the APC because they can’t cope with his domineering spirit.” He noted that Amaechi’s camp looks quiet at the moment but stated the former minister remains the arrowhead of the progressive block in the state. Also, another Policy and Public Affairs Analyst, Jude Ndubuisi, described the current movement of the gladiators to APC as an interesting game to watch ahead of 2027. He said, “As we move on towards 2027, things will become clearer, politicians in Rivers State prefer politics to governance. The problem we have in Rivers is that we don’t have the elite’s consensus, where there should be a point of agreement without breaking the bonds of unity, it is an interesting game to watch.” He, however, advised politicians not to play politics that will damage the investment climate. “In the past years, whenever Rivers State is mentioned, what comes to mind is a hotbed for crisis, but it’s time we begin to play politics that will not affect our environment.” For Mrs Patience Osorojiji, a frontline politician in the state, the three musketeers have the moral burden of how to accommodate their indiscipline, egos and ambition as they move to one political party. A chieftain of APC, Eze Chukwuemeka Eze and an ardent loyalist to Amaechi, it is laughable to see that Wike and Abe are jostling for the Rivers APC structure. Eze, erstwhile National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP), said the duo were conspirators in the fight against the party. However, political watchers have predicted a tough contest for control of the structure of the party at the expiration of the six months given to the caretaker committee to complete its assignment. .

       "   'content': \"A not-for-profit organisation, Ebony Ambassadors has empowered youths leveraging skills acquisition tools. Founder of the organisation, Irene Ani, said the initiative was to empower the youths for sustainability. Noting the high level of unemployment in the country, she said the way to go was to acquire skills. Relating her experience as a fresher in London 15 years ago and how skill acquisition saw her through school without a student loan, Ani said: “I learned how to make hair when I got to London and I made a lot of money from hair braiding, as a result, I didn’t take any student loan because I made enough money from hair braiding to sponsor myself for my first and second degrees. Seeing how I gained from learning a skill, I felt the young people in London didn’t take skill acquisition seriously, so I decided to start empowering them through skills.” She continued: “I am passionate about this project because in the UK, most people that go to school depend on student loans. I am one of the few who paid her fees for the skill I acquired. That spurred the passion in me even more and I want to empower these young people to do better. I am looking at replicating things that happen abroad here in Nigeria.” On funding, Ani said, “We get funding from local authorities in London to run workshops. So, we do have workshops for even the elderly, some of them are bored at home and want to engage in creative activities.” She revealed that the organisation plans to make the vision bigger by initiating partnerships with the government. “What we want to do is to create an avenue where we will begin a lot of cultural exchange where young people from here can come abroad and learn skills, learn how to use the machinery and come back to train people here to use it, it is a big project.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"The world is currently experiencing not greater multipolarity, but greater bipolarity. America and China are waging a new Cold War that is less about ideology and more about markets and technology. The West’s share of global output has fallen to about 50 per cent: the lowest since the nineteenth century’s age of imperialism. How should Africa understand and respond to these developments? The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) expanded last month to include Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Even with 10 members, Beijing still accounts for 60 per cent of the bloc’s GDP. Despite Washington’s bipartisan belligerence towards Beijing, China had been its largest exporter for 16 consecutive years until Mexico overtook it last year. Chinese leader, Xi Jinping’s unwise embrace of a personality cult and repression of dissent could, however, stall Beijing’s socio-economic progress. American presidential elections in November could return to power the nativist, bombastic Donald Trump. The re-election of Joe Biden, in contrast, would keep in the White House a dyed-in-the-wool Atlanticist. Trump’s return could present an existential threat to NATO, and usher in another era of protectionist trade wars. America, however, remains the world’s largest economy, accounting for 25 per cent of global output. Its technology firms and global cultural ‘soft power’ will guarantee it a place at the superpower top table for generations to come. The BRICS accounts for 46 per cent of the world’s population and 30 percent of its GDP. Its members are, however, status quo powers who are seeking to improve their own positions and reduce western influence in institutions of global governance. India accounts for 13 per cent of BRICS’s GDP and has become the world’s fifth largest economy. However, the chauvinistic Hindu nationalist regime of Narendra Modi’s ‘trinity’ of ‘Ds’ certainly has demography – with India having replaced China as the world’s largest population – but has fallen spectacularly short in the practice of democracy, and tolerance of diversity. New Delhi has long abandoned its Nehruvian non-alignment for an opportunistic foreign policy. South Africa’s charging of Israel for genocide at the International Court of Justice was not only consistent with its historical championing of self-determination, but was one of the most principled and courageous moments in its post-apartheid foreign policy. The country’s ‘strategic non-alignment’ has, in contrast, often lacked consistency and substance. Brazil’s $2 trillion economy is the world’s tenth largest, and the country accounts for 33 per cent of the economy of Latin America and the Caribbean. Last year’s return as president of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, saw the ‘second coming’ of one of the most popular figures in the global South. Lula’s pragmatism could help build bridges between the rich world and developing countries, especially as Latin American countries have largely ignored Washington’s discouragement of increasing trade ties with China. The West’s declining global influence is evident in the dramaturgy of the ongoing Gaza conflict in which Uncle Sam continues its performative power plays to little effect: Washington engages in endless series of futile ‘shuttle diplomacy’; U.S. vessels continue to be harassed by Houthi drones; while assorted regional militias refuse to be cowed by American military power, with fresh memories of Washington’s humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Unquestioning Western support for Israel’s continuing brutalities in Gaza is further weakening international support for Ukraine. So, what do these geo-political trends portend for Africa? The continent must exploit the economic opportunities provided by foreign investors, while continuing its elusive quest for Pax Africana by working to dismantle the military bases and end the external meddling of the U.S., France, Russia, and China. Africa’s continuing conflicts and climate change challenges across the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes will all require enhanced regional capacity and continued UN commitment: a major focus of UN Secretary-General, António Guterres’s ‘Summit of the Future,’ scheduled for September.

       "   'content': \"As a reward for driving value towards sustainable growth and market leadership, BUA Foods Plc has achieved a record market capitalisation of over N5 trillion post-consolidation and listing on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX). Driven by the desire to fortify its presence in the agribusiness and food-processing sector, Chairman, BUA Foods, Abdul Samad Rabiu, said the company has consolidated its diverse food businesses into a unified entity and listed by introduction on the NGX two years ago. “This not only streamlined operations but also bolstered the company’s capacity to capitalise on the growth opportunities and export potential presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). By consolidating the business divisions alongside two wholly owned subsidiaries, the company plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth, producing high-quality foods and creating long-term value,” he said. Adding that food security is their most important mission, he stressed that they are working fully towards fulfilling Africa’s food demands and improving the well-being of individuals and communities, distinguishing and positioning the company as an important player in Nigeria’s dynamic food sector and beyond. For the financial year ending 2023, BUA Foods total revenue reached N728 billion, marking a 74 per cent year-on-year increase, and underscores the company’s resilience and agility in navigating global and local economic challenges, with a notable compound annual growth rate of 30 per cent since 2021. Operating profit expanded from N79 billion to N213 billion between 2021 and 2023, respectively while profit before tax surged to N252 billion, compared to N102 billion in the previous year. Also, profit after tax soared from N69 billion to N111 billion, reflecting robust operational performance and effective cost management strategies. Notably, the total asset witnessed substantial growth, rising from ₦59 billion in 2021 to ₦734 billion in 2023, indicating the company’s strengthened financial position and operational scale. Over the past two years, Rabiu said they have remained steadfast in their commitment to delivering value to stakeholders across the capital market ecosystem, reinforcing their dominance and market leadership. “By facilitating increased liquidity at the NGX and providing returns to investors through capital gains and prompt dividend pay-outs, we bolstered confidence among shareholders and investors alike. Furthermore, our proactive approach has enhanced portfolio value and profitability for institutional and retail investors. The notable growth in share price, soaring from N40 to N320, translated to remarkable gains for investors and reaffirms our dedication to the food industry.” Moreover, the remarkable surge in market capitalisation, from N720 billion in 2021 to over N5.7 trillion in 2024, solidifies the company’s position as the fifth largest listed entity on the NGX by market capitalisation, further underscoring its resilience and enduring market prominence. Furthermore, the flour division of the business witnessed a substantial expansion in production capacity, increasing from 500,000 Metric Tonnes (MT) to 1,220,000 MT (152 per cent). At the same time, the pasta division saw its capacity rise from 250,000 MT to 500,000 MT between 2021 and 2023 (54 per cent). Additionally, it embarked on developing its rice business, with an initial production capacity of 200,000 MT leveraging its commitment to utilising locally sourced raw materials. This strategic approach, Rabiu said, not only supports national development plans but also fosters the advancement of Nigeria’s local rice industry, ultimately enhancing the economic prospects of local communities. Despite maintaining a consistent production capacity of 1,500,000 MT since 2021, the sugar division achieved a 53 per cent growth, underscoring its significance within the region’s sugar industry landscape. In the last two years, he added that they expanded their workforce by 57 per cent as a result of ongoing expansion projects in the different divisions thereby contributing to the country’s economic growth. “As BUA Foods embarks on its journey towards continued success, it remains firmly poised to navigate future growth and expansion with confidence and foresight. With a solid foundation and a clear vision guiding our path forward, we plan to leverage emerging opportunities to deliver sustained value for the foreseeable future” he added. Managing Director, Ayodele Musibau Abioye said, “In 2024 we believe our business structure and strategy position us to continue winning in the marketplace. We will focus on driving top-line growth in alignment with our established growth model, leveraging ongoing capacity expansion with product and pack innovation for sustainable growth in the short and long-term.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

It consists of a 1.6KM 10-inch jetty line connecting the facility to the NPSC jetty in Apapa, in-tank and in-line blending capabilities as well as other supporting infrastructure that can throughput about 700,000 MT per annum which is more than 50 per cent of the nation’s current LPG demand. Sowami stressed the project’s strategic significance for LPG supply security as well as price stability, noting that “this terminal when combined with our existing 6,000 metric tonnes LPG terminal in Oghara brings our total capacity to 30,000 metric tonnes. This gives us the required flexibility to receive propane, butane or even mixed LPG from local sources efficiently and blend in our facility to meet the local standards in addition to any quantity we may import”. Also reacting to the achievement, Ahmed said: “I am very impressed with this project, and I commend Ardova Plc for following all the due process. From the beginning, the company involved NMDPRA as a regulator, and we are glad to see that the progress on the project has been very efficient. “The company has put the requisite safety measures in place to ensure safe operation. The automation of the facility will help increase efficiency in what is already the largest LPG Storage facility in West Africa. “From the regulatory perspective, I can assure you, we are enablers of investment. We are here to encourage you in meeting the deadlines of delivering this project because the nation is waiting for it.” Also speaking, the MD of Ardova, Moshood Olajide, said the LPG facility is part of a total upgrade of its Apapa Terminal which will improve the storage and loading capacities across all products. He said the firm also built a new 52 million litres PMS storage infrastructure as well as a fully reticulated 15 million litres water hydrant system for the entire terminal as part of the upgrade.

       "   'content': \"The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) has called on the Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy to make clear to the government the roles of insurance in stimulating and sustaining the economic development of the country. NCRIB president, Prince Babatunde Oguntade, made this call while leading a delegation of the council to the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Gboyega Oyetola in Abuja, as part of strategic collaboration initiatives of the current leadership. He observed that the knowledge of government about the roles of insurance is still very low and takes the commitment of members and professionals in top executive positions in government to correct. He assured that the council would continually seek ways to add value to the Marine and Blue Economy Ministry, through required advisory services in insurance and risk management when engaged. Oguntade thanked the Minister for his past support, imploring him to use his strategic position to further toot the horns of insurance brokers with the government. The Minister, in his response, affirmed that he remained a proud member of the NCRIB and by extension, the insurance family, being one of the pioneer graduates of insurance from the University of Lagos. He assured the council of greater support and promotion of roles of brokers amongst his contemporaries in government. During the administration of the immediate past president, the board of the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), had to meet with the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, with a request to the government to ensure that ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), patronise the insurance industry through proper insurances for all government assets around the country. This received poor support and is an indication to the fact that the industry is no longer at ease with the poor treatment meted out to it by the government in the form of low level of recognition, support and patronage.

The post Embracing hybrid work structure III appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Since the beginning of February, we have examined closely, what the Hybrid Work Structure entails in which we explored (A) The impact of hybrid work structure on driving peak performance by considering both sides of the argument; we also brought insights to bear on and (B) The Pitfalls of Hybrid Working Structure and How To Avoid Them. This week which marks the third in this series, we shall be discussing how you can Effectively Lead Hybrid Teams. How To Effectively Lead Hybrid Teams According to a report by the Guardian, HSBC, one of the largest banking and financial services institutions in the world emerged as a pioneer in hybrid work models, recently winning the inaugural “Hybrid Working Award” at the 2023 Personnel Today Awards. The bank was specifically recognized for its “superbly structured and sustainable approach” that emphasizes digital innovation, inclusion, and meeting generational needs. In 2021, HSBC had previously launched a “Flexible First” policy enabling over 200,000 employees globally to work hybrid and remotely. This has enabled them to target reducing office space by 40%, including exiting their Canary Wharf London headquarters. Investments in collaboration technology have supported this shift and so far, the hybrid model has yielded positive results such as higher engagement and steady productivity. By providing flexibility and autonomy over when and where employees work, while still prioritizing inclusion, HSBC has set a progressive example of how teams and organizations can create modern, agile policies. Their reduction of corporate real estate also demonstrates the cost efficiencies enabled by hybrid models. For an organization to leverage leadership in accomplishing its vision, it requires effective leaders who can create a roadmap and execute its plans. Knowing how to use leadership as an effective tool can help a team understand its strengths and weaknesses to successfully achieve its objectives. Effective leadership is no doubt pivotal to creating a harmonious, high-performing environment via enhanced communication and transparency, to enable the free exchange of ideas among team members. It also fuels employee engagement, motivating individuals to go above and beyond in their roles, leading to a higher level of peak performance and innovation. At Amazon, employees are now required to be in the office at least three days a week. In a company blog post addressing staff, CEO Andy Jassy says the decision to transition to a predominantly in-person hybrid work model was made to help strengthen company culture: “It’s easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues… When you’re in-person, people tend to be more engaged, observant, and attuned to what’s happening in the meetings and the cultural clues being communicated.” Amazon adopted the company-wide policy after observing various models across the company, ranging from full-time remote workers to fully in-person teams. The goal? To achieve an employee experience that ultimately benefits the customer through continuous, collaborative innovation. Like Amazon, the Washington Post reported that Zoom executives decided to have its remote employees return to the office in 2023. While the company’s structured hybrid policy is focused on bringing people back into the office, it still offers plenty of flexibility. Team members who live within 50 miles of an office — about 35% of employees — are required to be on-site two days a week where they get to discuss issues with managers on a case-by-case basis and are encouraged first and foremost to help promote collaboration and a sense of culture. The Ford Foundation is another example of an innovative company taking a structured but flexible approach to the hybrid work structure. The nonprofit describes its hybrid work model as one designed to balance health, safety, and employee wellbeing while also optimizing team collaboration and a sense of community. According to their hybrid work policy, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are designated as onsite days for all staff, and employees can choose their third onsite day. But the policies don’t end there — there are also designated work hours for uninterrupted focus time. Fridays are “light meeting” days, regardless of where people are working. And three times a year, the Ford Foundation has what it calls “remote quiet weeks” when everyone works from home and non-critical meetings are suspended. Henry Ford in one of his many quotes said, ‘Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress and working together is a success. What this means, is that effective teamwork is more than the sum of individual efforts; rather, it is the synergy that propels a team towards greatness To effectively lead a hybrid team, here are a few points to note: 1.Set Clear Expectations Set expectations and make accountability clear to all staff in hybrid teams so that both home and office-based employees can work together productively and know who is doing what. As part of this, you might run daily or weekly virtual meetings with your entire team to start each day or week on the right foot. Communicate workflows and key deadlines, then share progress regularly to maintain momentum. 2. Share Work Schedules & Calendars With team members based in different physical locations, sharing work schedules and creating a shared group calendar where employees can indicate where they’ll be working each day will help to make sure everyone knows and understands where each team member will be working. 3. Use Reminders Create reminders or visual cues to include those who are not in the office to ensure everyone is receiving the same information at the same time regardless of location. One of the significant challenges in hybrid teams is ensuring that remote team members feel included and engaged. Encourage a culture of inclusivity by actively involving remote members in meetings, discussions, and decision-making processes. Consider rotating meeting times to accommodate different time zones and provide opportunities for everyone to contribute. 4. Invest in Continuous Professional Development Invest in the professional growth of your team members by providing opportunities for continuous learning. Offer peer mentoring, virtual workshops, or webinars that are accessible to both remote and in-office employees while also encouraging team members to share their newly acquired knowledge and skills with the rest of the team. 5. Ask for team input into flexibility. Hybrid teams thrive on flexibility. Recognize that different team members may have unique work preferences and requirements. Consider implementing flexible work schedules or offering remote work options on specific days. By accommodating individual needs, you create an environment that supports work-life balance and enhances employee satisfaction. 6. Conduct Periodic Team Assessment Regularly assess the effectiveness of your team-building efforts and make adjustments as necessary. Seek feedback from team members to understand their experiences and challenges. This feedback will provide valuable insights into areas that require improvement and help refine your team-building strategies over time. As a leader, it’s crucial to lead by example and embody the values you wish to see in your team. Demonstrate open communication, respect for diverse perspectives, and a commitment to collaboration. When your team members witness your dedication to the hybrid model and its associated principles, they are more likely to follow suit.

       "   'content': \"Some pension industry stakeholders have called on Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) to adopt new strategies to deepen Micro-Pension Plan (MPP) awareness to attract more Nigerians into the scheme. MPP, in line with the guided provision of PRA 2014, the National Pension Commission (PenCom), was intro¬duced with the objective of boarding pension coverage to include workers in the informal sector. Under the MPP, private sector organisations with less than three employees and self-em¬ployed individuals in the economy, who comprise over 87.9 per cent of working-class citizens, can participate in the contribution pension scheme (CPS). The stakeholders are concerned about the slow pace at which the scheme is going, since launched in 2019 by the immediate past president, Muhammadu Buhari. They said only 105,455 contributors have so far subscribed to the scheme and contributed N435.61 million in five years, representing an average contribution of N108.9 million yearly. Speaking on this development, Managing Director, IEI Anchor Pension, Glory Etaduovie, urged pension managers to craft a new strategy to drive acceptance of MPP among Nigerians, as a channel that can be applied to also drive financial inclusion. Head, Surveillance Department, at the National Pension Commission (PenCom), Ehimeme Ohioma, recently revealed that the total contingent withdrawal by MPP contributors amounted to N30.3 million while there was an increase in the conversion from the informal sector to the formal sector, amounting to N6.5 million, involving 587 Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders. Despite the slow pace with which the plan is running, the commission is hopeful that the initiative will contribute to economic growth by offering a reliable income source for pensioners and reduce dependence on others in old age, thereby lowering poverty rates as the objective of the scheme is to cultivate a savings culture among low-income earners and self-employed individuals. Explaining some of the problems preventing the scheme from rapid growth, Head of the Micro Pensions Department, Dauda Ahmed, said several implementation challenges faced include poor awareness, mistrust, insufficient incentives, low financial literacy, inadequate service delivery, poverty, slow adaptation of the scheme, issues relating to benefits payout, the need to simplify document requirements during registration and inflation. Former Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Oak Pensions Limited, Samuel Inyang, likened the slow pace of micro pension penetration to current economic challenges, as Nigerians are struggling to survive because of the high cost of food. He added that the economy has worsened in the last few years and most of those the scheme was meant to bring in cannot even feed. “It is only in a thriving economy that people can effectively save money,” he noted. He argued that there are no sufficient incentives to patronise the scheme from both the regulators and operators, saying the return on investment (RoI) is way below inflation rates, with no added value to those savings. According to him, there is little or no flexibility in the scheme, citing his experience while he was active in the industry, when a Nollywood actress queried why she should save her money in the scheme when if she needed to use it, there would be restrictions. “Despite all attempts to convince her, she insisted that she would rather invest in property than in a micro pension.” He called on the regulators to be more flexible in their approach and copy the model operated in Ghana that has lots of flexibility by both regulators and operators. ‘Savers should be allowed to withdraw as much as they want and once confidence is built, the Fund will do better in no time.” Industry expert, Usman Suleiman, said the surest way to rescue the scheme and stand a chance of realising the expectations of the government, is for the industry to invest massively in repackaging, publicising, promoting and selling it. He stressed that the informal and micro-operators are presently in great need of resource conservation and to enable them to voluntarily partake, such a scheme will have to be worth investing in. He added that the operators are not unmindful of the fact that the scheme has not made the desired impact since its inception and are working to engage the government to be part of it by also adding to what individual contribution is, as an incentive. Chief Executive Officer, the Pension Funds Operators Association of Nigeria (PenOp), Aguche Aguda, urged the government to support the scheme for expectations to be met. According to him, in countries where micro pensions have grown well, there is also government backing where governments add to individual contributions. “In countries like Rwanda and Kenya, their governments add to what individuals contribute. If an individual contributes 10,000, the government would also mark it up with N10,000. So, here in Nigeria, we are trying to engage the government for support.” You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"Global cybersecurity and digital privacy firm, Kaspersky, has disclosed that across all cyber threats landscape, Nigeria witnessed a 10 per cent drop in 2023. Kaspersky experts revealed this during the evolution of the cyberthreat landscape in the region during its ninth yearly Cyber Security Weekend – META 2024, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with a focus on the security of emerging technology trends such as artificial intelligence (AI). In parallel, the experts also raised concern targeting industrial control systems within critical infrastructure, in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Kaspersky’s Cyber Immunity approach took centre stage to create solutions that are virtually impossible to compromise and that minimise the number of potential vulnerabilities. According to the firm, Kaspersky’s telemetry showed that the number of overall cyberthreats in South Africa decreased by 29 per cent in 2023 as compared to 2022. At the same time, phishing attacks that use social engineering tactics to scam people into revealing sensitive information rose by 29 per cent. Over the same period, Kenya saw a decrease in overall threats by eight per cent while an increase was seen in ransomware attacks by 68 per cent, backdoors by 47 per cent, exploits by 22 per cent and phishing by 19 per cent. “Nigeria saw an overall decrease in all threats by 10 per cent while banking malware attacks designed to collect online banking credentials and other sensitive information from infected machines increased by eight per cent,” it stated. According to Kaspersky’s analysis, online threats caused by vulnerabilities on web pages, in emails or web services have fluctuated significantly in the region. Turkiye saw the highest number of users affected by online threats (41.8 per cent), followed by Kenya (39.2 per cent), Qatar (38.8 per cent) and South Africa (35 per cent). Fewer users were affected in Oman (23.4 per cent) and Egypt (27.4 per cent) followed by Saudi Arabia (29.9 per cent) and Kuwait (30.8 per cent). Director of META Research Center Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT), Kaspersky, Amin Hasbini, said: “As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, cyber threats continue to become diverse and sophisticated. This trend is particularly evident due to the emergence of advanced technologies like AI and the escalating geopolitical and economic turbulence within the Middle East, Turkiye, Africa (META) region. These factors collectively contribute to the surge in cybercrime and the heightened complexity of cyberattacks.” You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"The Federal Government has unveiled a new initiative targeted at connecting the entire country with Internet facilities. Done through a project of the Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, tagged ‘Project 774 LG Connectivity,’ the development seeks to address limited Internet and digital access by connecting all the 774 local government secretariats to the Internet. Announced yesterday by the Minister in charge of the Ministry, Dr Bosun Tijani, the project, which will be co-anchored by the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited and Galaxy Backbone, aligns with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s ‘Renewed Hope Agenda’ and the ministry’s strategic blueprint. Tijani, in a post on his X handle, added that the project’s overarching goal was to foster inclusive development and access to digital public infrastructure in government offices located all over Nigeria, including the most remote areas of the country that may have been previously underserved or unserved. Tijani said the connectivity programme would not only increase digital access but also create at least 300 jobs. “Project 774 LG Connectivity will create at least 300 direct jobs as we deploy nationwide and potentially more jobs indirectly from the increase in digital access. It is also aligned with our Ministry’s Strategic Blueprint and is a significant step in achieving President @officialABAT’s mandate to deliver efficient public service to our citizens at the LG level,” he said. The minister added that through strategic partnerships and the deployment of cutting-edge technology, Project 774 LG Connectivity will provide local governments with reliable and affordable internet access and resources required to deliver efficient public services, promote transparency in service delivery, stimulate economic growth and improve citizen engagement. “The implementation of this project is expected to drive transformation and unlock opportunities that will deliver sustainable development for all, through the power of connectivity,” he added. The ministry had also informed of plans to deploy Internet connection across all government institutions in the country to stimulate demand and encourage more investment in broadband infrastructure. According to him, many operators are not willing to lay fibre in many parts of the country outside the major cities because of low demand. Giving reasons for the slow development in the country, Tijani said this mostly had to do with return on investments, as there are areas the private operators considered not that profitable for business. However, to increase consumptions, he said the ministry was working to ensure that all public institutions across the country are connected to stimulate Internet demand and consumption, especially in schools, hospitals, government offices, libraries, markets among others.

       "   'content': \"Let me start with an adage literarily translated into English as thus: Instead of it getting better for the witch, all her children are girls, the birds are thus multiplying. – Bello-Olowookere (2005). What the foregoing proverbial saying implies is that a situation one expects to positively improve, rather continues to deteriorate day by day. This relates to the disturbing insecurity bedeviling our country. One would think with the coming of Bola Tinubu as the Commander-in-Chief of Armed Forces the ugly situation would be nipped in the bud. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case as it seems we are facing a renewed next level of insecurity. The matter is simply getting worse by the day. Perhaps I am not a security expert. But as a journalist, I am always terrified reading and writing reports of killings and kidnappings across the country everyday. Several have died. Many are dying. No one can tell who would be the next victims. Truth be told, all is not well with the country. Criminals are feasting on our fatherland. Bandits are reigning like wild fire. Kidnappers are having a field day. Gunmen are ravaging. Terrorists are on rampage killing, maiming and destroying our homes. As it is, it is dangerous to sleep with one eye closed. All eyes need to be open to be on the alert. Nigeria is bleeding. The people are pleading! To put things in perspective, throughout the just concluded week, hardly was there a day without report of killings and abductions. On Monday, unknown gunmen reportedly invaded a community called Gbauzokoyako located after Ketti in the Kuje Area Council of Abuja where father and son were said to have been killed. This was even as the assailants reportedly abducted five residents in the same community. Similarly on Monday, armed men assassinated two traditional rulers in Ikole Local Government Area of Ekiti State. This came at the same time when some gunmen abducted students, teachers, and a driver of Apostolic Faith Group of Schools in the Emure-Ekiti area of the state. Reports indicated that the abductors are demanding 100 million as ransom. Similarly on Tuesday, reports emerged that eleven farmers were killed in Firgi community, Pulka Ward of the Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State after stepping on Improvised Explosive Device (IED). On Wednesday, gunmen reportedly abducted two teenage sisters from Guita community in Chikakore, located in Kubwa, Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This was as 15 persons were reportedly killed after suspected herders attacked Ugboju community in the Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State. On Thursday morning, unknown gunmen terrorizing Nigeria’s capital city also kidnapped a director at the Federal Housing Authority in the Federal Capital Territory, Aondo Ver. Later in the day, armed men attacked Koro community, in Ekiti Local Government Area of Kwara State, killing the community’s traditional ruler, Olukoro of Koro, General Segun Aremu (rtd), and abducted his wife, alongside two others. Same day, a policeman was killed in Ebonyi State when gunmen attacked and engaged a police patrol team in a gun battle around Ngbo-Effium axis in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of the State. On the same day, gunmen beheaded a police officer identified as Inspector Osang. On Friday, reports emerged that gunmen abducted 30 women escorting newlywed bride in Katsina. This happened along Gamji road in Dandume Local Government Area of Katsina State on Thursday night. Similarly, Police in Borno State confirmed that four of it men where killed by insurgents during an attack on its quarters. All these happened just in one week! I am certainly not dishing out this number of attacks to scare you. It is just to tell you that all is not well with the country security situation. The security agencies seems to be overwhelmed. Perhaps, they too also have suffered many casualties in these attacks. The little they can do is to sympathise with the victims via press statements and courtesy visits, and condemn the attacks with threats to go after the perpetrators. Many approaches including changing the security chiefs, have been implemented to curb the menace, but none has proved to be effective enough. Therefore, it is time to take radical novel actions. Perhaps doing the same thing overtime with expectation of different results is tantamount to madness. On that note, the government must now look inward and adopt new strategy. On the way forward, I have two propositions to the government. First is the implementation of community policing. The need for state Police cannot be overemphasised. Debate has been going on over the potential good and bad of such security structure. But, the truth is that that is the only way to go. Those against state police are pointing out to possible abuse of the security architecture by the state governors. But, is that weighty enough in the face of these incessant killings? The Federal Police system, like I earlier said, is overstretched, overburdened, making it lose its grip on the security. Starting with number of foot officers, equipments, arms and ammunition, one can tell that the federal policing system cannot longer help provide adequate security for our communities. Only the state police would work as each state would be responsible for the security of its territory. Each state would have capacity to recruit, arm and deploy security operatives as it deems fit within its territory. With security vote and security trust fund, the state governments can properly fund state policing system. With this, governors would be responsible and can properly manage security ambience of their domains. The era when orders can only come from the Federal Capital City to all the 36 states of the federation is outlived. On the issue of potential abuse of the state police, that is also an issue of proper legislation. There should be checks and balances through creation of State Security Advisory Council which would comprise the state governor, security advisers, opposition parties, civil society groups, security experts and former military and paramilitary personnel. My second proposition is that the government needs to trustfully fight the insecurity by being aggressive towards these bloodthirsty insurgents. They are enemies and internal aggressors trespassing the Nigeria’s sovereignty. They do not mean well for the country, and so, they should be decisively dealt with. They should not be spared. They must be arrested, prosecuted, jailed and possibly eliminated to serve as deterrents to others. The trend of arresting these callous non-state individuals without proper prosecution is not helping the situation. The security agencies must top their game by ensuring speedy investigation and diligence arraignment in courts. If these bad guys cannot repent before staging attacks, their repentance after arrest should not be entertained. They deserve no shield or shelter in our community. They must be named, shamed and jailed. This would not only send a note of warning to individuals intending to orchestrate criminalities, but also would boost the morale of our frontline security operatives in their fight against insurgency. To this end, let me add that we, the citizens, also have our responsibilities. We must help the government and security agencies with intelligent information. We should raise alarm before events escalate. With our support and faith, the security agencies can get rid of these bad elements within us to make the country an haven for everyone to live. In addition, let us try to keep safe and be security conscious. I know that the government have the biggest responsibilities, but we need to play this little role. Adeleye wrote from Lagos.

       "   'content': \"No sane government should watch its citizens suffer untold hardship and live in poverty. The primary responsibility of government is to protect life and to secure the welfare of the people. President Ahmed Bola Tinubu spontaneously announced the removal of fuel subsidy on the day of its inauguration without considering the attendant consequences of such a decision. In fairness to the removal, the amount of money claimed to be payment of subsidy in Nigeria was quite humongous from N300 billion during the Good Luck Jonathan administration in 2012, to N2.7 trillion in 2022. However, beyond the doubt as to the authenticity of the real value paid on subsidy, the secrecy and corruption associated with the entire subsidy regime was very un-palatable. It was as a result of this, that many Nigerians canvassed for the removal of subsidy. Nevertheless, there are some other school of thought who believes that the government was not sincere on its own part due to the lack of transparency and accountability in petrol consumption and subsidy payment. Also, even where several reports indicting subsidy saboteurs were released, the federal government did nothing to investigate and prosecute those who were accused of corruptly enriching themselves from the subsidy payments. Therefore, the payment of subsidy on its own was not the problem but the willingness of government to come clean with its transaction on subsidy payment and muster the political will to pervert corruption amongst the stakeholders was the major problem. The view on re-introduction of subsidy becomes necessary given the fact that payment of subsidy is a common global practice by governments all over the world. It is taken to ameliorate hardship faced by majority of citizens in the purchase of very expensive commodities. In this case, Nigeria being a mono-economy driven by sales of crude oil, has made the price of every other commodities reflective in the rise or fall in the price of crude oil. The subsidy regime cushioned a lot of hardship amongst Nigerian in the past and with its removal today, Nigerians have not been able to recover from the effect, as we can witness the continuous increase in the prices of all commodities in Nigeria. Most workers do not report to work on a daily basis, some business closed shops and the general standard of living has reduced. Couple with this fact, is government inactiveness in controlling the hike in the prices of locally produced commodities. The lack of a price stabilisation and mechanisation control which was hitherto implemented in the 70’s have made it possible for middle men to determine the prices of commodities in the market. The practice of the middle men is to acquire these goods from the dealers and hoard them so as to create scarcity and speculate a market price before they sell, with wide profit margin. If government enforce the price control Act as ordered recently by the federal high court on goods and commodities that are locally produced in Nigeria, the hoarders and speculators would run out of business and food items and other commodities would be available at the normal rate. The lack of a price control mechanism is what led to the failure of most government policies on agriculture. It is so unfortunate that the past government of President Muhammed Buhari, made efforts to encourage local production of food commodities such as rice and even provided subsidies to farmers to embark on local rice production, but instead of having the price of rice reduced, it rather led to more than 200 per cent increase in the price of rice. Rice which was sold for N9600 before the ban on imported rice, skyrocket to N19,800, at a point, it rose to N36,000 and the government could not do anything to stop the hike. Under this present administration, a bag of rice sells for N77,000. It is an anomaly for government to provide incentives to local producers of commodities and at the same time, do not have control of the market price. In light of the above, in the interim, the Federal Government should re-introduce subsidy on petrol and diesel under a more transparent regime and deal with saboteurs who divert the products to other countries and in the long run, the Federal government should get our refineries working at optimum capacity so that any attempt to remove subsidy on petrol and diesel will not have much impact on the price on petrol. Also, a list of commodities and items produced locally should be established and the market price should be determined under a price control, stabilisation and mechanisation regime. The government should enforce the laws and policy on price control. Finally, for resource mobilisation, the government should stop oil theft so that more resources can be generated from crude oil and this would help us pay for the subsidy on petrol and also pay for the functionality of our refineries.

       "   'content': \"Sir: Nigeria as a country is at a crossroad once again. This crossroad could be the aftermath of the 2023 general elections or the seemingly lack of genuine attempt to balance the economic burden recently induced by the exchange rate of the Naira and make the country a productive nation. The crossroad could also be the demand for or rational recognition of the quick fix to taking Nigerian citizens to the desired point and impact them positively with the much elusive dividends of democracy since 1999. In the present Nigeria for example, there is the duplicity and prevailing predicament of weak institutions and infrastructure. On one hand, there is the section of inactive population intermittently wailing for change. On the other hand, there is a depressing, irregular, irritating and weak value of the Naira currency suffocating the involuntary import dependent Nigerian masses. These predicaments are coupled with irreversible but damaging compromise and corrupt practices in high places boldly staring everybody in the face. Unlike the Malaysian experience under Liquan Yew for instance, Nigerians have been vexed, agitated, pleaded and have continued to struggle, begging for who to politically take the bull by the horn and make Nigeria and its nationalities a working project. Consequently therefore, we as a people with unique time-honoured values must do the needful to change the narrative beginning from Edo State. Edo because, we are fortunate to have off-season elections, and have equally been opportune to see the devastating fallouts from the February 2023 General Elections, which as at today is not blowing anybody any good. On this premise, particularly on the burning desire to make Edo truly great and enduring project, we must demand critically examination of the forthcoming 2024 Governorship Elections and its projected outcome in the state. To start with, Edo State in the last seven years for instance, has seen observable, substantial and certain indices of specific and ensuing direction in the area of ICT. There is also evidence of developmental ability and dependable power supply from Ossiomo Power Plant to energise society and governance. In the area of certain policies, there is institutional sustainability drive such as Egov, EdoJobs, EdoHIS and EdoGIS as well as functional infrastructure like the Edo State Government backed Modular Refineries at Ologbo. These and many more are part of the judicious legacies brought to life by Governor Godwin Obaseki. Edo people must not allow them to prevaricate. To reinforce the above, Edo State citizens, irrespective of the divide, must anxiously look forward to September 2024 when we can elect Obaseki’s successor and the competent candidate who can lead Edo, based on tested theories of politics and universal welfarism. From the foregoing therefore, Edo needs competent candidate with character, integrity and global appeal to generate for instance, agro-allied facilities that are practicable. As a state, we need functional alternative energy, enduring infrastructure, healthcare as well as social services with new technologies and production. Above all, Edo State must be made an inclusive enclave by all and sundry, irrespective of political, social and religious beliefs. This is particularly compulsory in the formulation of legislations, policies and deterrent sanctions. This will enable a lasting peace and prevent discretional implementation of rules, principle and theories of government agenda. Only on these sacrifices can Edo State continue to climb the hierarchy of advancement so desperately desire by its people. All these put together are part of the assignments for Obaseki worthy successor starting from November 2024. • Oboh Sylvester is the director of Media, Edo State Ministry of Communication and Orientation.

       "   'content': \"With incessant killings and abductions of people ravaging all parts of the country, Nigerians are rightly united that if the unprecedented level of insecurity in the country persists, the consequences may be too grave for the government to handle. The country seems to have fallen under the control of gunmen whose activities are fast bringing it down. The nation’s descent into a theatre of bloodshed is a reality that must be addressed holistically, because the causes are also multiple. They include sheer criminality on the part of non-Nigerians seeking a territorial enclave, sometimes acting in concert with Nigerians at the local level. To some extent, insecurity is also a consequence of the high-level of hardship the masses are passing through, following government economic policy to remove fuel subsidy; and the seeming perennial fall in the value of naira. People have protested in Osun and Niger states against the hardship in the land. It is a signal about how hopeless Nigerians have become. For insecurity to be checked, the government must first take the battle to the criminals, wherever they may be hiding in the country. Attack, they say, is the best form of defence. Simultaneously, the government should practically and sincerely address the suffering in the land. The incapacity and lack of political will of people in the corridors of power are becoming obvious and unacceptable. Everyday, terrorists, kidnappers and other hardened criminals get more daring in their heinous activities, shooting at moving vehicles to abduct the passengers, planting Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) on major roads and ambushing and killing travellers freely. Nigerians now live in constant fear of being killed the next minute. At the same time, citizens can no longer adequately feed themselves, provide shelter, and pay hospital bills and children’s school fees. Farmers cannot go to their farms, traders and others are afraid of travelling to do business or for social engagements. Nigerians are forced to part with their life savings and properties, and even borrow money to pay ransom demanded by terrorists and kidnappers who abduct people largely unchallenged in the country. Regrettably, President Bola Tinubu was nowhere to be found amid these travails. He could afford to embark on a private visit to France, the purpose of which was not explained to the people. He was missing in the worst of times, and his action has been appropriately flayed as a flagrant display of insensitivity to the senseless and unprovoked killing of innocent citizens. The Federal Government led by Tinubu has a responsibility to prove to Nigerians and friends of Nigeria that it has not lost control of the country to terrorists and all other manner of criminals. Terrorists, bandits and kidnappers are having a field day since what has been described as the Plateau genocide, which they perpetrated in the state beginning on the eve of the last Christmas. They also mercilessly killed people in other states, particularly in the northern parts of the country. Recently, gunmen ambushed and killed two traditional rulers, the Elesun of Esun, Oba Babatunde Ogunsakin and Olumojo of Imojo, Oba Samuel Olatunji, in Ikole Local Government Area of Ekiti State while returning from a meeting. The Alara of Ara-Ekiti, Oba Adebayo Fatoba, who was the one driving the vehicle in which the three were travelling, managed to escape the attack. At about the same time, an unspecified number of pupils of Apostolic Faith Nursery/Primary School in Emure Local Government of the same state were abducted while going to Eporo Ekiti in their school bus. Terrorists also struck at the Sabon-Lugbe axis along Airport Road and Karmo district of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, abducting four people in separate attacks and vanishing into the Kuje forest, Karmo Hills and bushes with their captives. This incident happened 48 hours after five Almajirai and two suspected Boko Haram members died in an IED explosion suspected to be suicide attack and another explosion from IED planted by terrorists on the Pulka/Firgi road in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State that killed seven farmers in a commercial vehicle and injured seven others. Government stands to blame for its failure to secure the lives and welfare of the people, being the primary purpose of government as enshrined in the constitution. And it is to blame also for failing to provide critical infrastructure to support industry growth and SMEs for self-employment. More than 60 years after independence, and despite the fortune expended on the power sector, Nigeria has embarrassingly failed to provide steady electricity supply, and our leaders seem to care less, apparently because they can afford generators and fuel. Companies in Nigeria are relocating elsewhere on account of dismal electricity supply. Millions of citizens whose means of livelihood depends on electricity have been rendered jobless, new companies or investments are not springing up, while those managing to survive can hardly barely break even. Hundreds of parents can no longer sponsor their children’s education. To worsen matters, corruption in high places is thriving amidst the hardship. It is clearly inauspicious for Tinubu to embark on a foreign private trip at such a critical time, and from all indications, at public expense. For the country to get out of this dangerous state, the government must urgently address the plight of the people. While Nigerians have made a lot of sacrifice for the country to move forward, the leaders have not reciprocated and have failed woefully to show that they possess the character for the various offices they occupy. The stories of their insensitivity to the plight of the citizens, corruption, their style of governance and opulent lifestyle on public funding, replete with wastage and misapplication of national resources as well as their penchant for deceiving the people and not walking their talk, undermine, and in most cases, kill the spirit of patriotism in other Nigerians. They need to demonstrate that they are different from the criminals tormenting the country, given that both criminal activities and those of highly-placed public officials are inimical to peace and progress of the country. Tinubu must know that military and police operations alone will not win the war against terrorism and other criminal activities that now make Nigeria teeter on the precipice of failure. The government must be responsible to secure the country and make life liveable for all Nigerians. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

Each signatory country of the Cartagena Protocol should have biosafety laws and a biosafety agency to enforce these laws The post The deceptions of anti-GM crops activists in Nigeria and abroad (2) appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Continued from yesterday GMO crops are safe as any other food crop By law, before any genetically modified crop (GM) is released it undergoes intensive safety evaluations. Each signatory country of the Cartagena Protocol should have biosafety laws and a biosafety agency to enforce these laws, and Nigeria has done so. GM crops are analysed for their potential to cause adverse health effects and potential to cause harm to the environment. To this end, laboratory and field tests supervised by biosafety specialists, and specifically designed following guidelines agreed upon by the Government agency and the international communities are conducted with high scientific vigor. Their results are analysed by the national regulatory authorities, drawing on assistance from experts in the disciplines required to properly analyse the data. The chemical composition of the GM crop is compared to the composition of its sister line; if differences other than the ones intended by the transgene are found, then the GM crop is denied approval. This is called the equivalent compositional analysis, and guidelines for performance of such comparison provided by international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Codex Alimentarus, a commission established by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Health Organisation (WHO) are usually followed. The Genetic make-up of the GM crop is also analysed and submitted to the national biosafety for evaluation. In addition, both the USA and European countries have stringent laws about food safety. In the USA, at least three organisations are involved in genetically modified crop safety, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USDA APHIS (U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In Europe the European Union has a food safety agency in charge of all food safety matters in the Union (The European Food Safety Agency, EFSA). The main role of biosafety agencies or authorities is to ensure that released GM crops are safe to humans, animals and the environment. The processes of safety analysis are well described (Mendelsohn et al., 2013; Koch et al., 2015; Mathew, N., 2015; Megan L. Norris , 2015).A GM crop is authorized if and only if it passes all safety criteria. GM crops are analysed case per case basis. For example a transgenic soybean expressing the 2S albumin gene from Brazil nut was found to cause allergy (Nordlee, et al., 1996). Despite the noble objective of improving the nutritive quality of soybean by enhancing its content of sulfur containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine, two amino acids essential for health) this transgenic soybean was not approved and its development was stopped.. GMO food and feed have more than twenty years of safety record. During these twenty years, each day hundreds of millions of people consume GMO derived food in the USA, Canada, Brazil, China, Australia, Argentina, Japan, Korea, South Africa, and even in Europe. Per capita, Japan is one of the largest importersof GM soybean as food, as Japanese production of soybean represent only ¼ of the soybean consumed in Japan (http://agrochar.com/en/news/2280/japans-soybean-imports-to-reach-3-15mmt-in2015-16-and-stay-stable-in 2016-17.html). Not a single person in the world has been ill or died as a result of consuming GMO derived food. Annually hundreds of millions of animals are fed with GMO derived feed and there has not been a single documented case of adverse effects as a result of consuming GM feed. And the Europeans who are against GM cultivation are among the top ranked importers of GM food and feed in world. Annually EU countries import more than 30 million tons of GM food and feed and their animal industry is heavily dependent on this massive import of GM feed, with weak prospect of getting out of this dependency (TarjaLaaninen, 2015, COCEAL, FEDIOL and FEFAC, 2015). Twenty years of consumption of GM food and feed is the strong evidence that GM crops are safe. Despite this extensive safety record the anti GM groups continue to propagate false information about the carcinogenicity and danger of GMO for health. Citing articles published by authors like Seralini and coworkers (2007-2012), de Vendemômois et al., (2009) (this al includes Séralini) and Finamoreet al., (2008) the Anti-GM activists claimed that GM food crops are dangerous because they cause cancer, damage liver and kidneys and so on. In 2012 Seralini’s group published its most controversial article on GM maize and cancer in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology (Food and Chemical Toxicology 50 (2012) 4221–4231). The authors alleged that, glyphosate tolerant GM-maize as well as glyphosate caused tumors or cancers in mice. After many scientists have shown that Seralini’sexperiments had many flaws, he used wrong statistical methods to analyse the data, and he misrepresented the data, the Journal finally retracted the article (https://ac.elsbcdn.com/S0278691512005637/1-s2.0-S0278691512005637-main.pdf?_tid=05e6b914-e572-11e7-9b5e-00000aab0f27&acdnat=1513766534_b804a702d5c0ffe135ac9fecf9fc4108). The Experts of EFSA were among the first scientists to criticize the paper of Seralini and his coworkers). It should be noted that EFSA cannot be accused of being pro GM crops because it belongs to the EU, which is politically opposed to GM crops. Here we reproduce the whole abstract from the article published by EFSA in its journal 2012 10(10) 2010(the whole document can be found at http://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/ournal/10.1002/(ISSN)1831-4732/issues/) after examining Seralini’s article: On September 19, 2012, Séralini et al. published online in the scientific journal Food and Chemical Toxicology a publication describing a 2-year feeding study in rats investigating the health effects of genetically modified (GM) maize NK603 with and without Roundup Weather MAX® and Roundup® GT Plus alone (both are glyphosate-containing plant protection products). EFSA was requested by the European Commission to review this publication and to identify whether clarifications are needed from the authors. EFSA notes that the Séralini et al. (2012) study has unclear objectives and is inadequately reported in the publication, with many key details of the design, conduct and analysis being omitted. Without such details, it is impossible to give weight to the results. To be continued Conclusions cannot be drawn on the difference in tumour incidence between the treatment groups on the basis of the design, the analysis and the results as reported in the Séralini et al. (2012) publication. In particular, Séralini et al. (2012) draw conclusions on the incidence of tumours based on 10 rats per treatment per sex which is an insufficient number of animals to distinguish between specific treatment effects and chance occurrences of tumours in rats [for this breed of rats, OECD guidelines require at least 50 rats per treatment for cancer study; Seralini et al. used only 10]. Considering that the study as reported in the Séralini et al. (2012) publication is of inadequate design, analysis and reporting, EFSA finds that it is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessment. Therefore EFSA, concludes that the Séralini et al. study as reported in the 2012 publication does not impact the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate, and does not see a need to reopen the existing safety evaluation of maize NK603 and its related stacks. EFSA will give the authors of the Séralini et al. (2012) publication the opportunity to provide further information on their study to EFSA. The conclusion is crystal clear: Seralini’s article presents many important deficiencies; therefore it has little scientific value. Besides EFSA, six French National Academies (Agriculture, Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences, Technologies, and Veterinary Sciences) have rejected the scientific validity of the article of Seralini. We reproduce the summary of their declaration that can be found at http://www.academie-sciences.fr/archivage_site/activite/rapport/avis1012press_gb.pdf.:The French national Academies of Agriculture, Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences, Technologies and Veterinary sciences, became acquainted at the same time as the general public with the paper published recently one in the scientific journal Food and Chemical Toxicology by Gilles-Eric Séralini et al. where the authors claim that there is a strong tumorigenic and toxic effect in rats through consuming genetically modified NK603 maize or through low level exposure to the weed-killer Roundup® to which the maize has become tolerant. The 6 Academies signatory share the opinion that numerous methodological and interpretation shortcomings in the paper should not be held to invalidate previous research that concluded in favour of the sanitary innocuousness of NK603 maize and, in more general terms, of authorised, genetically modified plants consumed by both live-stock and humans. For a group of French scientists to be rebuked by six French National Academies is unprecedented in the history of that country. To be continued tomorrow You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'description': 'Documents show the secret investigation may have helped wrongly accused postmasters prove their innocence.',\n",
       "   'content': 'The 2016 investigation trawled 17 years of records to find out how often, and why, cash accounts on the Horizon IT system had been tampered with remotely. Ministers were told an investigation was happening. But after postmasters began legal action, it was suddenly stopped. The secret investigation adds to evidence that the Post Office knew Horizon\\'s creator, Fujitsu, could remotely fiddle with sub-postmaster\\'s cash accounts - even as it argued in court, two years later, that it was impossible. The revelations have prompted an accusation that the Post Office may have broken the law - and the government did nothing to prevent it. Paul Marshall, a barrister who represented some sub-postmasters, said: \"On the face of it, it discloses a conspiracy by the Post Office to pervert the course of justice.\" Senopathy Narenthiran, known as Naren, one of the convicted sub-postmasters who joined the legal action, wiped away a tear as he learned about the information that might have helped his case. \"By knowing all this, why do we waste all our time in the prison and separate from our family? I don\\'t know,\" he told the BBC. \"I\\'m 69 years old - too old to go through all these things.\" The secret investigation was uncovered through a BBC analysis of confidential government documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, from a time in 2015 and 2016 when the Post Office was under growing pressure to get to the bottom of sub-postmasters\\' claims of injustice. Hundreds of sub-postmasters had been prosecuted and jailed for cash shortfalls which were in fact caused by the Horizon IT system. They had long suspected that remote tinkering may have contributed to the problem. The documents show how the secret 2016 investigation - looking into Fujitsu\\'s use of remote access from 1999 onwards - had come out of a review by former top Treasury lawyer Jonathan Swift QC. The Swift review had been ordered by the government, with approval from then-business secretary Sajid Javid. It would conclude that it had found \"real issues\" for the Post Office. Mr Swift had found a briefing for the Post Office board from an earlier review in 2014, carried out by auditors from Deloitte and codenamed Project Zebra, detailing how Fujitsu could change branch accounts. Having seen that evidence, the Swift review said the Post Office must carry out a further investigation into how often and why this capability was used. Deloitte returned in February 2016 to begin the trawl of all Horizon transactions since its launch 17 years earlier. Ministers, including Mr Javid, were told this new work was under way to \"address suggestions that branch accounts might have been remotely altered without complainants\\' knowledge\". But in June 2016, when sub-postmasters launched their legal action, the government was told through Post Office minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe that the investigation had been scrapped on \"very strong advice\" from the senior barrister representing them. There is no evidence in the documents that then-prime minister David Cameron knew about the investigation or that it had been ditched. It meant that over two years, the Post Office had spent millions of pounds on three separate reviews into remote access - Project Zebra, the Swift review and the 2016 Deloitte investigation - while publicly claiming it was impossible. But all three were buried by the Post Office. Neither the Swift review nor Project Zebra were disclosed to sub-postmasters, depriving them of vital information that could have helped them in court; and the Deloitte investigation was halted before it could deliver its findings. Project Zebra, the first of the three reviews, was described as a \"desktop review\". The Post Office board had hoped it would give \"comfort about the Horizon system\" to them and others outside the business who had concerns about it. The consultants examined Horizon documents and talked to employees at Fujitsu and the Post Office to check how the system was functioning and whether it was achieving its objectives. Unredacted show that in April 2014, members of a sub-committee of the Post Office board discussed Deloitte\\'s Project Zebra work. The sub-committee included chief executive Paula Vennells, general counsel Chris Aujard and Richard Callard, a senior civil servant at the government body which owned the Post Office. The next month, Deloitte submitted its full report and in June it wrote a briefing for the Post Office board, which outlined two separate ways Fujitsu could alter branch accounts. Extracts from the board briefing are quoted verbatim by the Swift review but the briefing itself has not been released. It said the auditors had learned that authorised Fujitsu staff with the right database access privileges could use fake digital signatures or keys to delete, create or amend data on customer purchases that had been electronically signed by sub-postmasters. Fujitsu staff could then \"re-sign it with a fake key\". Deloitte said Fujitsu staff had also been able to correct errors using an emergency process known as a \"balancing transaction\", which can \"create transactions directly in branch ledgers\". It noted the process \"does not require positive acceptance or approval by the sub-postmaster\". Yet the findings of Project Zebra were never disclosed to investigating accountants Second Sight who, since 2012, had been publicly tasked by the Post Office with looking in to sub-postmasters\\' claims. The Post Office continued to claim for a further five years that it was impossible for remote tinkering by Fujitsu to alter cash balances in Post Office branch accounts. In 2015, it as it sought to prevent the broadcast of the first Panorama expose of the scandal, briefing them that there was \"simply no evidence\" that remote tinkering by Fujitsu could have caused branch losses. The documents that have now been analysed by the BBC reveal that following the Panorama broadcast, Post Office minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe wrote to the incoming chairman, Tim Parker, asking him to give the concerns about possible miscarriages of justice his \"earliest attention\" and take any necessary action. Business Secretary Sajid Javid approved the letter. Mr Parker said he would undertake a review of the Horizon system and \"various claims that sub-postmasters had been wrongly prosecuted as a result of faults in the system\", according to a briefing sent to Mr Javid on 20 November 2015, which was heavily redacted in the released documents. Mr Parker appointed Jonathan Swift QC and barrister Christopher Knight. They were so concerned about the implications of the Project Zebra documents, they said it was \"incumbent\" on the Post Office to find out how often these two means of altering branch accounts had been used, \"in the light of the consistent impression given that they don\\'t exist at all\". The Swift review, dated 8 February 2016, noted that the Post Office \"had always known\" about the balancing transaction capability. It also said the Post Office may be obliged by law to show the documents to postmasters who were seeking to overturn their convictions. In response to a recommendation in the Swift review, Deloitte was asked within days to return to the Post Office to carry out a full independent review of Horizon, following up on its work on Project Zebra. The mammoth and expensive task was to trawl back through all the transactions since Horizon began operating - work which was anticipated to take three months. In a letter of 4 March 2016, Post Office chair Tim Parker wrote to Baroness Neville-Rolfe about the Swift review\\'s findings and recommendations. That included informing her about Deloitte\\'s follow-up work. He said it would \"address suggestions that branch accounts might have been remotely altered without complainants\\' knowledge\" and review \"security controls governing access to the digitally sealed electronic audit store of branch accounts\". He added that he had \"commissioned independent persons to undertake the necessary work\", and in a later briefing informed the minister that this was Deloitte. The letter did not explicitly mention Project Zebra or Deloitte\\'s earlier findings about how branch accounts could be remotely altered. In April, the Post Office notified the government that the sub-postmasters had begun their group legal action against it. Baroness Neville-Rolfe and Mr Javid were sent a briefing, updating them on the investigation\\'s progress and discussing how the legal action would affect it. The briefing, sent before a meeting with Mr Parker, was heavily redacted when it was released under a Freedom of Information Act request. But it said Mr Parker was on track to complete the follow-up work by the end of May and would update Baroness Neville-Rolfe on its progress. However, the documents seen by the BBC reveal that in June, Deloitte\\'s three-month investigation was suddenly stopped just before it could be completed. On 21 June 2016, Tim Parker told Baroness Neville-Rolfe he had taken the decision on the advice of an unnamed senior barrister for the Post Office. He told her the detailed work being carried out by Deloitte was \"complex, costly and time consuming\" but that good progress had been made. \"I had hoped that by now I would be in a position to draw my investigation to a close,\" Mr Parker wrote. \"However, given the High Court proceedings to which I refer above, Post Office Limited has received very strong advice from Leading Counsel that the work being undertaken under the aegis of my review should come to an immediate end… I have therefore instructed that the work being undertaken pursuant to my review should now be stopped.\" In response to the BBC\\'s questions, Mr Parker said he had \"sought and acted upon the legal advice he was given\", but said it would not be appropriate to comment further while the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal was ongoing. Baroness Neville-Rolfe told the BBC she had said publicly that she had instructed the Post Office chairman to commission an independent review, but declined to comment further while the inquiry was ongoing. Mr Javid also declined to comment because of the public inquiry. In his High Court judgment at the end of the sub-postmasters\\' legal action in 2019, judge Sir Peter Fraser found the Post Office\\'s defence claim - that Fujitsu could not insert transactions in branch accounts - was \"simply untrue\". He said the Post Office had \"expressly denied\" that remote access was possible \"and that denial is now shown to be wrong\". The barrister who represented a number of wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters, Mr Marshall, told the BBC it looked as though the Post Office had conspired to pervert the course of justice. \"The important feature of all of this is that in 2014, it appears that the Post Office board was alive to the true position - that remote access by Fujitsu was possible,\" he said. \"And yet the Post Office board was responsible for maintaining and advancing the Post Office\\'s defence to the sub-postmasters\\' claim in 2019 - that it was impossible. That was false - and, it would appear, known to be so.\" Paula Vennells, the former chief executive of the Post Office, did not respond to the BBC\\'s requests for comment. Chris Aujard, then Post Office general counsel, and Richard Callard, the civil servant who represented the government on the board, declined to comment while the public inquiry was ongoing. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the government body which owns the Post Office, addressed what the board knew about these successive reviews and investigations in an opening statement in 2022 to the ongoing public inquiry into the Horizon scandal. It said there was no indication in the minutes of the Post Office board meeting in June 2014 that the board had received the Project Zebra briefing. UKGI said Mr Callard \"does not recall ever receiving such a briefing\". The statement said the board had not asked for a copy of Deloitte\\'s full report at the time of Project Zebra. UKGI said the board had been given an executive summary by the Post Office general counsel Chris Aujard, which was \"focused on Deloitte\\'s approach to the review but importantly did not set out its findings\". It said the board had also never received the 2016 Swift report, nor been briefed in detail on its findings. The statement said Tim Parker did not send Swift\\'s full report to the Post Office Board and that his letter of 4 March 2016 to Baroness Neville-Rolfe did not make clear how serious the Swift review\\'s findings were. The revelations uncovered by the BBC also raise serious questions for the public inquiry by Sir Wyn Williams, as to whether it is adequately scrutinising what the government knew about the Post Office\\'s internal investigations. In UKGI\\'s 2022 statement to the inquiry, there was no reference to Tim Parker\\'s letter to Baroness Neville-Rolfe of 21 June 2016, notifying her he was calling off Deloitte\\'s investigation. In 2018, two years after completing his review, Sir Jonathan Swift, formerly First Treasury Counsel - the top civil lawyer at Her Majesty\\'s Treasury - was appointed to be a High Court judge. He received a knighthood in the same year. However, in the list of upcoming witnesses at the Williams inquiry, his name is absent. Deloitte submits a briefing for the Post Office board on Project Zebra, outlining how Fujitsu can alter branch accounts or change records of transactions remotely. Business Secretary Sajid Javid approves to Post Office chair Tim Parker, urging him to take \"any necessary action\" about Horizon, after a Panorama whistleblower reveals how Fujitsu can remotely alter postmaster\\'s accounts. Mr Javid is to look into claims that sub-postmasters have been wrongly prosecuted as a result of faults in the system. The resulting recommends a full independent investigation into how often and why Fujitsu altered accounts and records \"throughout the lifetime\" of Horizon. he has commissioned \"independent persons\" to address \"suggestions that branch accounts might have been remotely altered without complainants\\' knowledge\". In , Mr Parker tells Baroness Neville-Rolfe that in the light of the sub-postmasters\\' group legal action, on \"very strong advice from leading counsel\", the investigation by Deloitte has been immediately stopped. It never completes its work.',\n",

       "   'description': 'MPs want to question Henry Staunton on allegations he was told by an official to \"stall\" compensation.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Henry Staunton alleges he was told to stall payments to allow the government to \"limp into the election\", apparently to help state finances. The government denied the claim and Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch is set to make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday. Mr Staunton has stood by his comments. Following his claims, Liam Byrne, Labour MP and the chair of the Business and Trade Committee, told the BBC that he wanted to question Mr Staunton at a session next week. The committee will be hearing evidence from Post Office chief executive, Nick Read, and Alan Bates, a former sub-postmaster whose battle against the Post Office inspired the recent ITV\\'s drama into the scandal and thrust it back into the spotlight. Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches. Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined. Some have since died. The government has promised to quash convictions and pay compensation, but concerns have been raised over the speed and complexity in victims securing financial redress, with just 33 claims fully settled. One sub-postmaster said the process of It would be Mr Staunton\\'s second appearance before the committee, after he answered questions from MPs in June. Mr Byrne told the BBC\\'s World at One: \"We\\'ve got to get to the bottom of which senior official, he says, told him to go slow on the payments because we\\'ve got to remember that the government is bringing forward a bill which is going to overturn the convictions and I want to use that bill to hardwire into our legislation a fixed timetable for actually getting all of the compensation payments sorted.\" Mr Staunton, who has been on boards of companies ranging from ITV to WH Smith, was appointed as chair of the Post Office in December 2022, but was dismissed by Ms Badenoch, who said last month that \"new leadership\" was needed to tackle the scandal. But , the former chair said he was told by a senior civil servant to slow down compensation payments to postmasters. \"Early on, I was told by a fairly senior person to stall on spend on compensation and on the replacement of Horizon, and to limp, in quotation marks - I did a file note on it - limp into the election,\" he told the paper. \"It was not an anti-postmaster thing, it was just straight financials. I didn\\'t ask, because I said: \\'I\\'m having no part of it - I\\'m not here to limp into the election, it\\'s not the right thing to do by postmasters\\'.\" The Post Office has been asked if the note that Mr Staunton claims he files exists on its servers. Mr Staunton also said that when he was sacked, Ms Badenoch had told him: \"Someone\\'s got to take the rap.\" The government has denied the claims about delaying compensation and in a lengthy social media post, Ms Badenoch hit back at Mr Staunton, calling his comments a \"disgraceful misrepresentation of my conversation with him and the reasons for his dismissal\". \"Far from \\'taking the rap\\', I dismissed Staunton due to very serious allegations about his conduct while chair of the Post Office, including blocking an investigation into that conduct,\" she said. Ms Badenoch said she would make a statement on Monday \"telling the truth\". Following the backlash to his interview, Mr Staunton said on Monday that it was in the \"interest of the business, as well as being fair for the postmasters, for there to be faster progress on exoneration, and that compensation was more generous, but we didn\\'t see any real movement until after the Mr Bates programme\". \"I think it\\'s pretty obvious to everyone what was really going on,\" he added.',\n",

The format saw members of the public question the prime minister on issues such as migration and the NHS. The UK\\'s communications and broadcast regulator said it had received around 500 complaints about the programme. In its statement, Ofcom added it was investigating the programme relating to \"due impartiality requirements\". An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We are investigating under rules 5.11 and 5.12 of the Broadcasting Code which provide additional due impartiality requirements for programmes dealing with matters of major political controversy and major matters relating to current public policy. \"Specifically, rules 5.11 and 5.12 require that an appropriately wide range of significant views must be included and given due weight in such programmes, or in clearly linked and timely programmes.\" During the broadcast, presenter Stephen Dixon said the questions to be asked by undecided voters had not been seen in advance by the Prime Minister or by GB News. Sunak was the only guest on the programme, which lasted an hour. The Q&A session was followed by analysis and interviews with members of the audience. The broadcaster is currently being investigated by Ofcom for a number of other shows, with many of those reviews covering impartiality issues. The issue of political figures such as Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and former Conservative deputy chairman Lee Anderson presenting topical programmes has also prompted criticism. Former pensions minister Esther McVey and backbencher Philip Davies are also worked as presenters on the channel. The right-leaning network was founded by businessmen Andrew Cole and Mark Schneider to challenge established British news providers, and launched in June 2021.

       "   'content': \"International Trade Centre (ITC) has said technology will be highly essential in the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative. It, therefore, urged governments in the region to see it as a priority. ITC, which said AfCFTA was expected to increase the size of Africa’s economy to $29 trillion by 2050, noted that the digital sector is a great driver of intra-African trade. It noted that services such as digital trading platforms and cross-border digital payment services were vital to make the AfCFTA a practical success. AfCFTA, according to ITC, is expected to increase the earnings of nearly 68 million people, who make less than $5.50 a day and lift 30 million Africans out of extreme poverty; increase Africa’s GDP by $450 billion by 2035 while raising global GDP by $76 billion; increase African exports by $560 billion; increase wages for both skilled (9.9 per cent) and unskilled (10.5 per cent) workers and stronger trade facilitation would account for $292 billion of the $450 billion in economic gains expected from it. The body, in its ‘African Market Trends in Technology Services’ document, which profiled 11 countries, including Nigeria, said digitisation and the use of technology are essential to implementing and driving the AfCFTA effectively. However, it noted that the continent lagged behind other regions in adopting and using digital technologies, saying: “For example, just 40 per cent of Africans use the Internet. That compares with Internet penetration of 64 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region, 83 per cent in the Americas and 89 per cent in Europe.” ITC observed that the relatively low Internet penetration in Africa was primarily due to the high cost of the service, limited reach in rural areas, connectivity disruptions and a lack of digital skills and literacy. It noted that the challenges in the nature and extent of infrastructure on the continent were, to some degree, being addressed through extensive training and digital connectivity initiatives. “However, the good news is that the uptake of Internet and digital tools is rising rapidly, which supports the realization of AfCFTA goals. Full implementation of the agreement can transform regional markets and economies and enhance service, manufacturing and natural resource productivity. “There are several cases of how digital technologies act as a mechanism to implement AfCFTA successfully, such as through the AfCFTA Hub and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS). Adoption, knowledge and use of these platforms can help IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) companies become better able to trade digitally on the African continent.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

Agba wrote: “To my good people of Edo state and esteemed members of our great party, the All Progressives Congress, I want to thank you for your loyalty and support for my candidature. “Unfortunately, what we have all witnessed in the APC party primaries in Edo State on Saturday February 17th, 2024 falls below the minimum standard of democratic elections that is universally acceptable. “I believe strongly that thousands of loyal party members were disenfrachished. Based on the authentic turnout we clinched victory. The result so far announced is a ridicule and undermines the principles of democracy and fair play. The votes of the people did not count, the processes of election were compromised and the strength and unity of our party greatly undermined. “While I remain a loyal party member, I will not be part of a process that robs the mass of our loyal party members of their inalienable right to vote. What has taken place in Edo State negates all that even our political leaders have taught us over the years about democracy, the will of the people, one man, one vote and justice and fair play.” Adding: “We must come together to challenge this great injustice and restore the integrity and strength of our great party. “Such Impunity that the people have been subjected to should have no place in our great party. “We will proceed speedily within the guidelines laid down by our party to seek for justice. “I want to thank everyone that has supported me for your unwavering commitment and belief in our vision and qualification. Your passion and dedication have been the driving force behind our campaign, and I am truly grateful. “As we move forward, remember that our journey is far from over. We will continue to fight for a better future for Edo State, a future where every citizen can thrive and succeed. “Our resolve is unbreakable, and our commitment unwavering.

       "   'description': 'The 2023 Transparency International (TI) Report of the global Corruption Perception Index (CPI) clearly indicates that corruption is still rife in Nigeria. The post Nigeria’s ranking on the Global Corruption Index appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.',\n",
       "   'content': \"The 2023 Transparency International (TI) Report of the global Corruption Perception Index (CPI) clearly indicates that corruption is still rife in Nigeria. According to the report though, on a scale of 100, Nigeria improved marginally in the CPI score from 24 points in 2022, to 25 points in 2023. Although the one-point improvement over the period may need to be acknowledged, this does not appear salutary at all. Out of 180 countries surveyed, Nigeria was ranked 145 and thus very much in the company of countries with very high incidence of corruption in their national life. Sadly, and quite instructively, Nigeria’s score of 25 points is even far below the sub Saharan African average score of 33 points, clearly indicating that even by African standards, Nigeria is a country laden with high levels of corrupt practices. And this cuts across virtually every sphere of national life. The Report further stated that in the past 10 years, beginning from 2014, which covers the entire period of the Muhammadu Buhari administration, Nigeria’s CPI scores have hovered between 24 points and 28 points which do not indicate significant progress in the fight against corruption. The peak of 28 points was attained in 2016 during the early years of the Buhari administration when the euphoria of the fight against corruption was at its ascendancy. After then, the CPI score for Nigeria had since taken a decline, indicating that the fight against corruption under President Buhari was a fluke. This is indeed sad. While there may be the need to acknowledge and possibly celebrate the little win, given the slight increase of Nigeria’s CPI score from 24 to 25 points over the 2022-2023 period, it is appropriate to identify the areas from where this little win came from. The details in the Transparency International Report identified three factors that contributed to putting some pressure on the system leading to slight reduction of the incidence of corruption over the period. First, the launch of the Beneficial Ownership Register in May last year which identified and kept a record of persons with significant interest in companies with proper liaison with the Corporate Affairs Commission had some effect. This enhanced the close monitoring of interferences in say, the public procurement process, among others. The other contributory factor is the activity of the media, civil society and the citizenry which from time to time constructively engaged the authorities on the need to address the corruption issue. Third, is the periodic arrests and recoveries made by anti-corruption agencies of the government. All these contributed to one form or the other in the little gain experienced. This clearly shows that with all hands on deck, the incidence of corruption in Nigeria can be reduced. The role of the citizenry and the media is very critical in salvaging the Nigerian society from this cancer of corruption. Many newspapers on their own have not relented in frequently crying out on the need to save the next generation from this disease. The need to restructure the governance structure, to devolve powers to the sub-national governments have been one of the issues being raised by the media as one of the areas to reduce the incidence of corruption by ensuring that too much power is not domiciled at the central government which is a pure breeding ground for corruption. As the saying goes, “power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”. The other issue that the citizenry can leverage on in this fight against corruption is the full utilisation of the government whistle blowing policy which helps to nip the incidence of corruption in the bud as well as enhance the “name and shame” strategy which have their value addition in this regard. The recommendations in the Transparency International Report are worth taking seriously by the government and the entire Nigerian society if the fight against corruption will be frontally executed to save the next generation from an imminent ruin. While the small wins are to be appreciated, there are various other issues that need to be addressed, going forward. As articulated in the Transparency International Report, these include unchecked electoral corruption, judicial corruption, corruption in the security sector, opaqueness of public institutions such as the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited and others, incidence of rewarding corrupt and questionable individuals with public appointments, wasteful expenditures in government and failure to prosecute high profile cases expeditiously, among others. Indeed, the fight against corruption in Nigeria is far from being over. The key issue is to learn from the experience of countries that have brought the incidence of corruption to a very bearable level. These include countries such as Singapore and other Asian countries that have been able to transit from a “third world” to a “first world” status. Nigeria needs a benevolent and firm leadership given that, as the saying goes, “the fish starts to get rotten from the head”. Once the citizenry perceives elements of sincerity in the leadership, the effect will simmer down to the grassroots and the results will be more than the one point marginal progress recorded between 2022 and 2023. Nigerians now hardly trust the integrity of the electoral process. They equally do not trust the integrity of the judiciary as clearly articulated in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index Report. Nigeria must address this issue of culture of impunity, and this drive must start from the top. Except the fight against corruption is taken more seriously, Nigeria will just be gravitating to a nation state where corruption becomes the order of the day. The 2023 Transparency International Corruption Perception Index Report should be taken as a wake-up call in this regard. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"‘Trend pushing investors to exit property market’ With Nigeria’s naira dropping to a record against the U.S. dollar following several policy summersaults by the apex bank, the real estate sector is feeling the heat as foreign investors are experiencing huge losses in the value of their investments, and struggling with diminishing potential returns when repatriating profits to their home country, writes CHINEDUM UWAEGBULAM. These are the best of times for foreign real estate investors as ongoing currency devaluation is harming the property market by reducing rental income and prompting huge decrease in their return on investment due to higher cost of living. The situation has reached a crisis point as investors are exiting the economy, especially the real estate sector because the investment climate is no longer attractive. The exchange rate since the end of last year 2023 till now has been quite unstable, with a dollar being exchanged close to N1, 500 in the black market. Exchange rate is one of the factors usually considered by the international real estate investors in their quest to build wealth from investment properties in a foreign country. This has affected all the segments of the market as the prevailing inflationary economy has rendered prices all-time high. It is expected since the prices of goods and services went up uncontrollably in the country after the Federal Government announced the removal of fuel subsidies. In the Lagos area, the prices of properties, residential, commercial, and industrial have gone up by unimaginable proportion and the same for the yearly income by way of rentals and leases. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations is particularly pronounced in the construction phase. This is primarily attributed to foreign exchange (FX) policies contributing to the devaluation of the naira. It has affected all aspects of the real estate industry as property development involves raw materials like cement, paints, bitumen, equipment, doors, and roof cover, which are either imported or used in production. The exchange rate is also affecting labour costs as the workers, including consultants’ purchasing power, are declining daily. Construction projects often involve sourcing materials from abroad, and the devalued currency means that a larger amount of domestic currency is needed to obtain the same quantity of imported building materials. The exchange rate problem has also affected cost of construction and impacted on developers practicing off plan and forward sales as price changes will affect their contract with their customers. “As a result, the construction industry experiences increased costs and challenges in budgeting thereby leading to delays and disruptions in the delivery of various projects. This dynamic underscores the significant influence of exchange rate policies on the construction sector and its overall operational efficiency,” according to the Chief Executive Officer, Knight Frank Nigeria, Mr Frank Okosun. He explained that a devalued local currency initially attracts foreign investors to the real estate market due to increased affordability. “This heightened demand drives property prices up. However, if the currency depreciation continues, it poses a challenge for long-term investments, as it diminishes potential returns when repatriating profits to their home country. This erosion of returns discourages the enduring investment appeal traditionally associated with real estate,” he said. According to him, the impact of FX and currency devaluation on foreign direct investments and inflow from Nigerians abroad is a nuanced situation. “Initially, investors are drawn by the value and volume their currency can yield, making the country an attractive investment destination. However, challenges arise during the repatriation of profits. “Unfortunately, we’ve observed a continuous year-on-year decline in capital importation, particularly in foreign direct investments. This decline stems from low investor confidence, primarily influenced by the difficulties faced in accessing foreign exchange for profit repatriation. The naira’s volatility and the associated challenges in securing foreign currency act as significant deterrents to potential investments.” One of the major effects is that foreigners are exiting the sector. Okosun said foreign brands are strategically adjusting their presence across various real estate sectors, with economic challenges playing a significant role, especially foreign exchange fluctuations affecting the repatriation of their profits. “In the retail subsector, a notable example is a major institutional investor who, in response to these challenges, listed their retail assets for sale last year. This demonstrates a dynamic response to market shifts,” Okosun said. He said that foreign exchange fluctuations are a macroeconomic challenge that reverberates across various sectors, including real estate. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive measures at the macro level. To address this, Okosun said government should stabilise the currency, support local production, improve the ease of doing business, attract foreign investment, and create a transparent regulatory environment, adding that a well-rounded approach to improve balance of trade is crucial for sustained growth in the economy before the impact trickles down to real estate sector. The former Chairman, Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV) Faculty of Estate Agency and Marketing, Mr Sam Eboigbe, said with the recent trend, foreign investors are intentionally watching with caution, save those buying for other purposes like family occupation. “The foreign investors in benchmarking the value or the worth of their investments in view of the prevailing exchange rate are recording huge losses in the value of their investments and rate of returns.” He cited a typical case, where an international investor in a closure of property deal worth N450 million last year April when the naira was exchanged at about N550 against the dollar (black market) sold the same property in January 2024 for about N600m. “Now, in analysing this transaction and benchmarking in foreign currency like the dollars, and in view of the prevailing exchange rate, it is obvious that the foreign investor would not be delighted with the outcome of this transaction. “In April last year, the worth of his investment was in the neighbourhood of $818,000, while the same investment that has appreciated significantly in naira as of January 2024 is in the neighbourhood of about $400,000. The same applies to the rate of returns by way of yearly income from the same property investment. Your guess is as good as mine, while foreign investors would not be willing to go by the prevailing exchange rate to invest in the real estate sector.” Eboigbe, who is the Principal Partner, Sam Eboigbe and Company, disclosed that foreign investors are presently minimising their losses and waiting for a favourable economic climate that would restore a remarkable level of confidence to the value of the naira against the dollar. “The grievances of international investors are essentially due to an unstable foreign exchange market, thus making their investments experience a downward slide in value. The investors have lost a huge amount of their resources channeled into the real estate sector,” he said. He advised the government, as a matter of urgency, to declare emergency in the sector and take tough measures in reducing the pressure on the foreign currency, especially the dollars from the government quarters. “The Federal Government that was courageous in the removal of fuel subsidy should similarly ban all forms of foreign trips embarked upon by the officials of the government. We will make savings in foreign exchange when the president places embargo on such foreign trips. The ambassadors should be representing the president and others in such foreign outings. “The official vehicles of all elected and appointed officials should be locally supplied. The entourage of all categories of elected and appointed officials should be scaled down drastically to reduce the cost of fuels. The government is further advised to demonstrate sound political will to revamp our refineries and save us the huge amount of foreign exchange required to bring in refined petroleum products.” A Professor of Estate Management, University of Lagos, Austin Otegbulu, stated that the steady declining value of the naira against major currencies has attained a crisis dimension. “It’s really trying to choke the economy to death. The exchange rate crisis has affected all sectors of the economy, including real estate. This is so because inputs to real also have foreign components triggering cost push inflation and cost over-run in real estate related projects,” he said. According to him, with the steady fluctuations in exchange rates, it’s difficult to budget for real estate projects as the cost of construction inputs is changing frequently without a corresponding increase in investment returns and value. Secondly, with scarcity of foreign exchange, it will be difficult to repatriate earnings related to real estate investment, while the purchasing power of citizens is on a downward trend, and this will likely diminish or erode effective demand. Otegbulu said the Federal Government needs to, through the Central Bank of Nigeria; develop a blueprint that will save the economy. “We need to discourage wastefulness in the economy and fund more of the activities that will increase the inflow of foreign exchange into the country. The rescue mission should be total and comprehensive. It will not be easy to rescue one sector like real estate and leave the others because all the sectors are inter-connected,” he added.

       "   'content': \"Cries of hunger and despondency in the land have left the realm speculation. The confusion and hardship in communities have reached a pitiable state, where citizens don’t have assurances of how the next meal can be put together, not because they’re lazy, just that the means of production have been heavily taxed by government. When citizens protested in Minna, Niger State, the other day, the government and the ruling party cried foul. They alleged politicians were behind the protests to cause disaffection in the polity. Governors on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), then decided to raise the lamentation a pitch higher than citizens’ often muffled and discounted voices. It had been said that occupants of Aso Rock, Nigeria’s seat of power, develop hearing problem the moment they lock themselves away from voters, once they gain power. Former President Jonathan once regretted that he was sequestered within the iron curtains of Aso Rock, from the realities of the outside world. They no longer hear cries of the masses. Nonetheless, the PDP governors, led by their chairman, Bala Mohammed, rightly observed: “the cost of living is skyrocketing, and we’re almost on the road to becoming like Venezuela.” The governors confessed supporting removal of fuel subsidy at the beginning, believing that there would be safety nets to cushion the impact. They now realise that things are not adding up, especially with the free fall of the naira. They admitted that the responsibility to fix the economy did not lie with the Federal Government alone, but that policies on monetary and economic matters are squarely those of the central government. They tasked the Tinubu government not to lead the country beyond the current misery and poverty levels. Venezuela is a metaphor for misgovernance and squandered opportunities. Just like Nigeria, the country is rich in oil and gas, but has a misery index score of 330.8, the worst in Latin America as of 2022. In 2020, Bloomberg’s Misery Index ranked Venezuela the most miserable country on planet earth, using tallies on inflation and unemployment conditions in 60 economies. Soaring prices and unemployment are signs to look out for in measuring a country’s misery status. Hunger and lack of food security are part of it. So, Venezuela is not the place to go and the PDP governors were right to warn about that. The Federal Government thinks it’s mischief to compare situation in the country to that of Venezuela. The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, reminded the PDP governors that they are critical players in the economy and they should as well be accountable. He said: “Since President Tinubu assumed office, the revenue available to the three tiers of government has more than doubled. All the 36 states, including the 774 local governments, have been receiving significantly larger allocations on the back of the reforms being pursued by President Tinubu to reposition our national economy.” Idris tasked Nigerians to ask the PDP governors how far and well they have utilise their allocations. Yes, governors of PDP and of other parties owe Nigerians explanation regarding what they’re doing to cushion the hardship in the land. They collected monies from the Infrastructure Support Fund (ISF), to build feeder roads and invest in agriculture. That was in July 2023. They got part payment of the N5 billion approved by the president to provide palliatives for their constituents in September. There have been other bailouts to states for the purpose of making living comfortable for the people. Certainly, governors have questions to answer, but the overall responsibility to direct the economy is that of the Federal Government. If the intervention of PDP governors was seen by Abuja as playing to the gallery, the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) pointedly blamed the Federal Government’s incoherent policies and laid-back attitude to governance for worsening insecurity and economic hardship in the country. The party cited the near 30 per cent inflation, 41 per cent unemployment and 46 per cent poverty rate as unbearable conditions that threaten the survival of the country. If that was not loud enough, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar 111, at a Committee Meeting of the Northern Traditional Rulers Council in Kaduna, last week, presented a stark picture of the poverty and hunger levels in the North, calling on government to urgently find solutions. He said: “…I don’t think it is the issue of the new government. To me, this government is a continuation of the former government; it is the same party. So, what really is the problem? I think that is one of the reasons we are here to talk to ourselves.” The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) were among those in attendance, to take another look at the issues. Instead of the usual pushback and denial by the people in government, this is the time to admit that the economy is in dire straits. The price of cement changes every other day. Cooking gas is going out of the reach of many. Producers of bread are threatening that consumers still need to pay more for the product. Government is threatening to discontinue payment of subsidy for electricity. Importers are paying more duties and other levies are on a steady and unannounced increase. Government’s response to the hardship it created should go beyond throwing money at the problem in the name of palliatives that don’t deliver substantial and comprehensive relief. Government should admit that the hardship is the consequence of its obsession for all manner of taxes, especially tax on imported petrol. Under normal circumstances, an oil producing country should not incur extra costs for petrol that is refined in other countries. It’s worse, transferring all the liability to citizens and then pretending to use palliatives to ameliorate the damage. The palliatives and monies shared to governors do not solve the problems. Mopping up cash from citizens is the cheap gimmick of a parasitic government, thus rendering millions of citizens economically inactive. Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda promised the arrival of prosperity. He assured of diversifying from over-dependence on export of crude oil and importation of finished products, which are unhelpful. He announced more attention to agriculture, the young population and industrial growth. Under his government, he said: “We will improve existing industries and sectors. We will be brave and innovative enough to see how new economic vistas powered by today’s technology can create jobs and provide goods and services that will propel us toward greater prosperity and development.” Unfortunately, in the first eight months of the administration, manufacturers are reeling under high energy and infrastructure costs, with government still threatening to remove what it claims to be energy support in allegiance to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Many companies have closed shop as the president’s dream to unleash economic growth has suffered grave reversal. Instead of growth, the economic policies have decreed higher costs and higher inflation. More people are becoming less productive and consumers’ capacity to buy has gone down. In designing the agenda, Tinubu identified the surge in inflation (less than 20per cent then) as one “driven by global supply and production disruptions beyond the control of anyone government, including Nigeria’s. This is supply-driven inflation, not inflation caused by excess demand in an overheated economy. “To impose the usual anti-inflation medicine of higher interest rates and tighter money-supply will only weaken the patient. The answer to supply-driven inflation is not to suppress normal aggregate demand levels. The better solution is to findways to increase production and supply. To suppress demand will result in the overall loss of economic activity and jobs. “Worse, since the inflation is grounded in supply side issues, placing this weight on the demand side will do little to answer the root causes of current inflation. In short, we punish the national economy and the people without deriving any meaningful benefit.” This is exactly where we are. It is important to remind Tinubu of his postulations while on the campaign podium, for him to see the difference between rhetoric and performance. It is either these theories were copied to fill space in the agenda document, even when the writers do not understand them,or they are justmere jargons to mislead voters. It was the same way Tinubu postulated on fuel subsidy when the administration of Goodluck Jonathan attempted to remove it in 2012. Tinubu presented what was a populist road map to fuel subsidy removal that will not hurt citizens. Very well written document. Today, he has done far worse than what he criticised. Apart from removing fuel subsidy, which he dubbed the Jonathan tax in 2012, his government has pauperised millions in anti-people schemes. Tinubu petrol tax is pushing struggling SMEs out of existence. The power sector is in a coma. Many fear that despite good ideas and intentions on paper, this government may not summon the will to reform limping sectors where active players in government have direct and entrenched interests through proxies. That’s why it may be stuck with a non-performing power sector for a while. At the end of the day, more money will be thrown at problems rather than fixing them. In fighting corruption, the Renewed Hope Agenda said: “We will continue the work of the current administration (Buhari’s) in reforming the civil service to fight corruption, reduce bureaucracy, streamline agencies and decrease inefficiency and waste.” We didn’t see any reform in the Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Ministry. Some Presidency associates picked monies from Betta Edu before she was disowned. Then the Presidency deftly ordered the suspension of the entire Social Investment Programme (SIP); and by that the excitement generated by Edugate was systematically deflated. That’s not how to fight corruption. Let all those who picked monies from Betta Edu be investigated and tried. Publicly, not in locker-room plea bargains. You must be logged in to post a comment.

       "   'content': \"Though Nigeria started 2023 with 226.2 million telephone lines, by year-end, the number dropped to 224.7 million, showing a depletion of about 1.5 million lines out of the networks. The year 2023 appeared to have been turbulent for telecommunications operators, as statistics showed a monthly reduction in the number of telephone connections. Subscription statistics from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for December, which completed the year, revealed the trajectory. The new figures were released at the weekend. Specifically, in January, there were 226 million telephone lines; February, 227 million; March, 226 million; April, 223.6 million; May, 221.2 million and June, 220 million. Others are July, 220.8 million; August, 220.7 million; September, 221.7 million; October, 222.1 million; November, 223.2 million and December, 224.7 million. Recall that late January 2024, the regulator, in a statement, explained that it updated telecoms indicator, which affected the country’s teledensity, broadband penetration and other metrics. NCC noted that the adjustment became necessary to reflect latest population growth figures and align with international best practices. The adjustment reflected in the telecoms industry’s statistical reports for September, October and November 2023, published by the commission, and was predicated upon the Nigerian Population Commission’s (NPC) population projection of 216,783,381 citizens, as of 2022, replacing the previously used 2017 forecast of 190 million people. Consequently, the updates impacted telephone subscription for the latter part of last year. Further analysis indicated that Second Generation (2G) network remained dominant technology by ending of last year. It had 57.84 per cent penetration; 4G came second with 31.33 per cent; 3G, 9.80 per cent and 5G, 1.04 per cent. Amid the economic challenges in the country during the period, Internet subscription witnessed persistent growth to end 2023 with 163.8 million users. Specifically, the GSM players had 163 million; VoIP, 249, 816; Internet Service Providers (ISPs), 213,876 and Fixed Wired, 21,104 customers. Broadband services also climbed a bit, closing the year with 94.7 million users and 43.71 per cent penetration, as against 90.3 million users and 47.36 per cent recorded in 2022. It should be noted that the rebased indicator by NCC was responsible for the difference in growth. Additionally, Nigerians are consuming more data. The statistics showed that by the end of last year, data consumption was 713,200.6 terabytes. In January 2023, it was 517,670.15 terabytes. In April, Nigerians consumed 655,879.86 terabytes of data, by September, it dropped to 653,257.86 and 645, 407.1 in November. Nigeria’s teledensity, which was also impacted by the update by NCC, leapt to 103.66 per cent. It was 102.97 per cent in November and 102.49 per cent in October. Teledensity is an index prescribed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for the measurement of telephone penetration in a population by a factor of one line per 100 individuals. The data showed that MTN consolidated its position as the largest operator in Nigeria during the period under review. The telecommunications firm ended last year with 87 million users and 38.79 per cent penetration. Airtel had 61.8 million customers and 27.55 per cent market reach; Globacom with 27.45 per cent penetration, serviced 61.6 million users and 9mobile, with 6.21 per cent spread, had 13.9 million subscribers.

       "   'content': \"In the last week of January 2024, an emergency gang calling itself Coalition of Concerned Nigerians made publication accusing Vice Admiral Emmanuel Ikechukwu Ogalla, Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), of oil bunkering, contract splitting and fraudulent procurement. The dubious group then asked President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to remove Ogalla from office. Good enough, the Nigerian Navy wasted no time exonerating its chief. Rear Admiral Adedotun Ayo-Vaughan, its spokesman, forensically destroyed the three false charges. “Indeed, all arrested vessels mentioned in the publication that were involved in crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering are being investigated and none of such vessels has been released as alleged. Secondly, the CNS does not award or oversee oil bunkering contracts; the award of such is the sole prerogative of NNPCL. Thirdly, all contracts awarded by the navy follow due process in line with the laws of the Federation.” Then he gave an important revelation. The launching of Operation Delta Sanity by the navy scared oil theft cartels who believed none could confront them. Their response was that sordid publication, “Fortunately, the recent achievements of the NN in this regard have put them on their heels hence the resort to cheap blackmail through immoral and compromised online media publishers…. Accordingly, members of the public are therefore enjoined to discountenance completely the malicious publication. It is totally untrue and completely baseless, being a figment of the shallow imagination of the writer, his publishers, and their unpatriotic sponsors.” The matter could have ended there but for Bello Matawalle, Minister of Defence for State, declaring he was probing Ogalla. Will Matawalle probe an innocent and gentleman officer based on the spurious claims of unhappy entities who contracted themselves as willing tools in a proxy war? But for close to two months now Major General Danjuma Ali-Keffi (rtd) has been shouting that Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, former Chief of Army Staff, COAS, and eleven senior officers were blown out of the sky by explosives planted in their plane by terror financiers in the military. Why is Matawalle not probing Ali-Keffi’s claims? Are we seeing differential justice in situ? Tellingly, the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, and Auwal Musa Rafsanjani have called for probe into the assassination of Attahiru even though Matawalle will not act. Nigerians want answer to why Attahiru was killed. They want to know why Ali-Keffi was unjustly arrested, detained, tortured and dismissed from service. These are genuine national security questions deserving Matawalle’s attention than the nauseating ululation of decrepit characters. The whole truth is that on May 21, 2021, Attahiru and eleven of his officers met their untimely death. Ali-Keffi holds the clues to what happened: He was briefed by phone on the sudden and unusual changes that charactised Attahiru’s last flight, heard the midair explosion that claimed his boss and also recovered the victims’ burnt remains. With his determined voice getting louder and louder since January 2024, the perpetrators who stole the one billion dollars meant for arms procurement, in addition to making more billions from illegal gold mining and oil bunkering, thought of diverting attention from the Attahiru question by instigating unrest. By blackmailing Ogalla, they hoped to stir up the South East against President Tinubu. In their equation, Ogalla is soft target coming from a part of Nigeria perceived hostile to the president. But they grossly miscalculated. Rather than being fooled we are privileging Attahiru’s assassination. We shall also give prognoses of what could happen anytime. Nigerians must be warned against hurriedly responding to high-profile assassinations not to set one ethnic group against its neighbours. Looted billions and military-grade weapons are in the hands of desperate men who will kill again to cover their crimes against their fellow officers. Attahiru is gone, Ali-Keffi dismissed and Ogalla tagged. Remain Vigilant. Attahiru Nigerian Tribune of March 13, 2021 carried the headline, “Reps to Army Chief: Come Explain how Military Weapons Got to Bandits.” The invitation was extended by the Olaide Akinremi-led Committee set up by the House to review the purchase, use and control of arms by the military and other law enforcement agencies. The committee was also mandated to uncover how purchased weapons ended up in the hands of terrorists and bandits. The military chief invited was Attahiru. By character and training, he was totally dedicated to protecting Nigerians from internal and external enemies. The committee was established following the alarm raised by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Mohammed Babagana Monguno (rtd), who warned that the new military chiefs, Attahiru was one, had not seen any proof of arms procurement in their records and hand-over notes on assumption of office. That the former military chiefs could also not account for the trillions of naira voted for arms in the fight against terrorists. Recall that on assuming office as COAS, an overwhelmed Attahiru, with his men mowed down by bandits and terrorists, cried out that his armouries were empty. That the army he inherited was bereft of weapons with no document showing that purchased weapons were in transit. It was further revealed that captured terrorists surrendered weapons stolen from armouries across military formations. It was high treason denying our gallant soldiers weapons while arming enemies of Nigeria. Attahiru failed to appear before Committee sending Major General C. Ofuche instead. This led to postponement of proceeding to enable him appear in person. Then in April 2021, the Senate Committee on Army led by its Chairman, Ali Ndume, met Attahiru. The latter repeated Nigerian security challenge would be difficult to address without weapons. It was at this stage when Attahiru thought things were panning out, following Ndume’s reassurance, that the conspiracy against him was sprung. On May 21, 2021, Attahiru’s departure time from Abuja to Kaduna was delayed by over three hours. His plane was switched. Whereas his destination airport was the Nigerian Air Force Base, Kaduna, his plane was mysteriously diverted to the Kaduna International Airport. When he was finally air borne, the COAS flew into inclement weather that further kept him in the aircraft. Then as his plane made the final approach to landing, a huge explosion on board killed him and eleven other senior officers. The dead stay dumb. Attahiru knew too much. With his death nothing more was heard of terror financiers in the military nor the stolen one billion dollars, running into trillions of naira, meant for weapons. Till date no treacherous coalition has called for probe into Attahiru’s assassination even when Ali-Keffi told Nigerians what happened. Ali-Keffi’s revelation Denied of fighting equipment, Attahiru relied on clandestine warfare to fight non-state actors. His Operation Service Wide (OSW), was mandated to dismantle terror financing network. Ali-Keffi headed this group, effectively devising a strategy to infiltrate and misinform the leaderships of the Boko Haram and Islamic State for West African Province, ISWAP, terrorist groups. This created mutual distrust leading to the killing of the Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, by rival ISWAP. What made Ali-Keffi a marked man was his report as President of the Board of Inquiry, BOI, investigating sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria. In his recent petition to President Tinubu protesting Attahiru’s assassination and his own travails, this is what Ali-Keffi, inter alia, said about oil bunkering and terror financing as published by Premium Times of January 22, 2024: “The Board of Inquiry…was tasked to investigate circumstances surrounding the illegal smuggling of petroleum products contained in 168 oil tankers into Benin Republic through a single smuggling route in Ilesa Barbara in Kwara State. The most worrisome aspect was that some of the individuals involved in terrorism financing of Boko Haram terrorists and who were also involved in procurement and movement of arms and ammunition for BH (Boko Haram) and other criminal organisations had links with the military. “It was thus apparent that terrorism and insurgency in the North-east, North-west and North-central were a criminal enterprise and were largely undertaken with profit rather than any ideology, as the primary motive. Thus, we, at the BOI arrived at the obvious conclusion that progress cannot be achieved except the financiers, collaborators, supporters and the leadership of the terrorists and insurgents groups are identified and the network dismantled.” Improbable possibilities First, weapons stolen from our armouries included Shoulder-to-Air Missiles capable of bringing down aircraft at low altitude. Eke wrote via: chigachieke@yahoo.co.uk and 081 3515 9313. Suppose those blackmailing Ogalla, failing to incite the South East against President Tinubu, instruct their minions in the Boko Haram to use such missiles to bring down a passenger liner or even the presidential jet? That was what led to the 1994 Tutsi Genocide. French mercenaries shot down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana’s jet and Hutus blamed and massacred their traditional Tutsi enemies. Was there a nexus between the activities of non-state actors in Rwanda and the downing of the aircraft? The answer is yes. Do terrorists in northern Nigeria have the capacity to shoot down planes? Again, the answer is yes because they have missiles. And secondly, our national security can never be guaranteed until the humongous illegal gold mining in Zamfara and Osun States is checked. Billions from stolen gold fuel internal violence. Was there a link between illegal diamond mining in Siera Leone and that country’s civil war? The answer is yes. Can illegal gold mining drag Nigeria into civil war? The answer is yes: Report of the Ali-Keffi-led BOI clearly implies that. Our credulity is the new danger. None believed young Folorunsho Ariyo and Nabeeha Al-Kadriyar could be shot by kidnappers and their bodies left by the roadside. Their killings marked the turning point as our collective psyche was dented. Nigerians now believe anything. Therefore, we must be cautious responding to assassinations and moral panics not to play into the hands of enemies capitalising on our impaired judgement. Conclusion Ogalla is innocent and must be left alone to do the job his Commander-in-Chief assigned him. The conspiracy against him is a poor attempt to divert attention from the May 21, 2021 incident that killed Attahiru. Matawalle should be probing those behind the explosion. Finally, President Tinubu should, as a matter of utmost national importance, beef up security around Ali-Keffi till the probe into Attahiru’s assassination is completed and findings made public. Ali-Keffi is deliberately denied security to make it easier for the very terrorists he fought to kill him. Nigerians want justice for this citizen: His petition should be addressed, unjust dismissal reversed and rank restored. Eke wrote via: chigachieke@yahoo.co.uk and 081 3515 9313.

The exercise, which began peacefully, ended in chaos. “We also condemned, in a very strong term, the attempt by Uzodimma to subvert the will of Edo people by declaring fictitious results from the 18 local councils in the absence of collation officers, who were officially sent to various local councils. Dekeri, popularly called DANCO, is, indeed, the man of the people with proven capacity to win the general elections in Edo across the 18 local councils. “As critical stakeholders of the party, we stand with Dekeri. We stand by him, and we want to assure the good people of the state that succor is on the way. MEANWHILE, Okpebholo has faulted the congratulatory message from the National Chairman of APC, Ganduje, to Dennis Idahosa, who claimed victory at the primary election, describing the action as misleading and an attempt to give credence to his rival’s claim to victory. Okpebholo, who spoke through the Director of Media and Publicity of Senator Monday Okpebholo Governorship Campaign Organisation, Godswill Inegbe, said Ganduje, as the father and respected leader of the party, couldn’t have hurriedly issued a congratulatory message when controversies and other issues characterised the announcement of the results.

       "   'content': \"Eggheads in the built environment will meet this week to proffer solutions on the lingering housing deficit bedeviling the country at this year’s Housing Circuit Magazine Awards Dinner in Abuja. The Vice President, Kashim Shetima and Minister for Housing and Urban Development, Umar Dangiwa are among dignitaries billed to attend the event, themed: ‘Bridging Housing Deficit in a Thriving Economy.’ According to the organiser and Chief Executive Officer, Housing Circuit Magazine, Mr Seun Jegede, “this is derived from the constraints facing the housing sector and other aspects of the nation’s economy amidst global downturn.” He said despite these challenges, hope of deliberate attempts to increase the nation’s housing stock is rekindled with the official launch of the Renewed Hope Cities and Estates programme and subsequent ground-breaking ceremony for a 3,112-housing unit pilot site in Karsana district, Abuja, adding that the housing scheme if properly implemented would provide affordable homes and bridge the yawning housing gap in the country. Jegede stated that the award, which started in 2010, is geared towards appreciating outstanding industry players, policymakers and consummate icons who have distinguished themselves in their chosen areas of influence and expertise, particularly within the building, construction mix and infrastructural development. “After an extensive effort, the editorial team has carefully selected a few icons who have achieved monumental feats in their respective fields of endeavours. “‘In view of the current state of things in the country, this year’s effort is modest and restrained but still a partial fulfillment of what has become an avenue for practitioners in the industry to gather and reflect on issues in a convivial atmosphere,” he said. The ceremony will draw participants from the presidency, sub-nationals, National Assembly, mortgage finance parastatals, state commissioners, estate developers, investors, real estate enthusiasts, artisans, professionals, and major players in the built industry. Among the awardees are former Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and Senator representing Jigawa North-West Senatorial District, Hussaini Uba. Others are Director-General, National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Prof. Ayo Omotayo; former Director, Public Buildings and Housing Development, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Solomon Labafilo and Accountant General, Gombe State, Dr Aminu Umar Yuguda.

       "   'content': \"•FMDQ FX market turnover dips by 56.2% Consumer price level is projected to settle at 30.34 per cent year-on-year (y/y) in February 2024. According to analysts at Cordros Capital Research, the impact of the heightened conflicts in the North and the rising transport costs are expected to undermine food access and disrupt distribution networks over the short term, amid the traditionally high purchase reliance for food during the post-harvest period across the country. “At the same time, we expect the persistent currency pressures and elevated energy costs to keep the pressure on the core basket intact. Accordingly, we forecast consumer prices to settle at 30.34 per cent y/y in February,” they said. The analysts stated that the increased consumer prices synchronised with the effect of chronic FX pressures, high food demand-supply gap, mainly attributable to below-average harvests and elevated diesel and gas prices. Accordingly, they noted that broad-based pressures across the food inflation (+148bps to 35.41 per cent y/y) remained at a 19-year high whereas core inflation rose by 53bps to 23.59 per cent y/y. On a month-on-month (m/m) basis, the consumer prices surged by 35 basis points (bps) to 2.64 per cent (December 2023: +2.29 per cent m/m) the highest point in five months. In addition, Cordros Capital Research, unveiled a three-year regulatory action plan (RAP) for Nigeria’s upstream oil and gas sector aimed at increasing crude oil production (including condensates) volumes to 2.60mbpd by 2026. However, it argued that frequent leaks from pipelines and intermittent oil terminal shutdowns for repairs could pose downside risks to crude oil production in the near term despite the FG’s efforts to combat crude oil theft and vandalism. “As a result, we maintain our estimate that crude oil production (including condensate) will settle at an average of 1.59 mb/d in 2024E (vs FGN’s estimate: 1.78mb/d),” it stated. Meanwhile, in the foreign exchange (FX) spot and derivatives markets, the total turnover for the week ending on February 16, 2024, was $1,065.66 million, representing a decrease of 56.2 per cent ($1,369.47 million) from $2,435.13 million reported for the previous week. According to FMDQ Securities Exchange, the week-on-week (w/w) decrease in the total turnover was driven by the 48.2 per cent ($990.63 million) and 99.41 per cent ($378.84 million) decreases in FX Spot and FX derivatives turnover, respectively. The exchange stated that the w/w decrease in FX derivatives turnover was solely driven by the 99.4 per cent ($378.84 million) decrease in FX forwards turnover. There were no trades executed in either the exchange-traded FX futures or cleared naira-settled non-deliverable forwards (Cleared USD/NGN NDFs) markets. In the FX Spot market, the total value of transactions for the week ending on February 16, 2024, was $1.063 billion, representing a decrease of 48.23 per cent (990.63 million) from the value of transactions executed in the week ending on February 9, 2024 ($2.05 billion).

       "   'content': \"Browsing the word ‘cyberbullying’ on Google and seeing ‘Alex Iwobi’ as the search result is worrying. Alex Iwobi is now the cornerstone and the garri soaking the disappointment and rage of Nigerians who recently got a silver medal from AFCON. Super Eagles Skipper, Ahmed Musa, had urged Nigerians to halt the cyberbullying directed towards Alex Iwobi, a midfielder for the Nigerian team. The Super Eagles had given the AFCON cup to the Ivory Coast on Sunday and Iwobi was picked as a major cause of the failure for Netizens. It was obvious that the negativity hurled at Iwobi was massive and dehumanizing. According to the report gathered from the online sphere, most netizens believe that Iwobi played for the Super Eagles because of familial connections to Jay Jay Okocha, one of Africa’s greatest footballers and not because he was capable. The use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another individual is known as cyberbullying. Threats made online as well as nasty, combative, or nasty texts, tweets, posts, or communications all qualify. Posting private and spiteful images, videos, or other content with the intention of hurting or embarrassing someone else also counts and this is what is happening right now to Iwobi following the loss of the AFCON Cup on Sunday night. As a public figure, it is expected that you will receive lots of criticisms but receiving insults, threats, spiteful words and blame for the failure of a national team who went to the finals through luck is outrageous. We complain of the negative effects of social media but it is still we human beings that make it toxic for our fellow human beings. Cyberbullying is a serious crime that has grave consequences especially on the image of a person and the mental health of victims. It could also lead to suicidal attempts and emotional disturbances. Summatively, it seems Alex Iwobi is the main reason why Nigerians lost the cup. We forgot the coach, other players and a government that could not deem it fit to supply electricity for Nigerians to watch their beloved country on an Ivorian field. There is a big difference when I tell you that “Thank you for playing for the Nigerian team. I appreciate your patriotism and desire to serve the country through football. However, I don’t think yesterday’s night was your best. Even if connections worked for you, I believe you have the talents and skills that can be improved upon for the best of you and for Nigeria as a whole. Wishing you the best.” and “You are a useless goat. You were just playing rubbish. See you ugly thing. See as you made Nigeria look stupid on the field.” This is from two different mindsets who wanted to criticise something but because of who they are within, the output is different. Logging in to Twitter and seeing a Twitter user calling Alex Iwobi a very useless player with a pointless ponytail is disheartening. Another online user had wished Alex wasn’t born so he wouldn’t play for Super Eagles. Truly, a prophet (footballer) is not welcome in his own house. Online Nigerian users calling their brother useless, a fool and an animal because of the loss is heartbreaking for the Nigerian spirit that was positive days ago before the finals. An X (Twitter) user, Eric Okafor, had blamed the cause of the toxicity on social media influencers. In his words, “We love Alex Iwobi and we are more proud of him. This is what happens when you people let influencers gaslight you into being as toxic as social media allows. How else will they justify regulating social media? Pick sense today.” Another Twitter user blamed two popular social media influencers, and for starting the bullying. “Nigerians are very toxic”, a user of Twitter account commented. This was done to Uzoho, Bukayo and many other public figures in the past and it is fast becoming a normal culture – a culture of bitterness and hate. We have to caution influencers and opinion makers to mind what they instigate their followers to do just for the sake of engagement. Not respecting a fellow human and using him or her as an object to engage more followers or make money is barbaric. Alex, wherever you are, you did the right thing by going off from social media. Who sees a raging fire and would not run? It’s not pleasant to come online and see your name trending with negativity and majority of the people you are representing are spitting hate in words and pictures. Take off from social media, travel, be close to God and recover from the online shock. I am with the X (Twitter) user, SarkinFoto on this one, ‘we are united against negativity’.

       "   'content': \"In a renewed effort to bridge the housing gap, the Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN) has begun the profiling of private developers, who will assist in the execution of its 77,400 local council housing projects across the country. The housing programme tagged: ‘Rural-Urban Housing Initiative (RUHI-774), is an initiative of REDAN aimed at developing 100 housing units in each of the 774 councils of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). PAN-African housing development financier, Shelter Afrique is funding for the project. RUHI-774 targets the low and middle-income earners, especially civil servants, and first-time homebuyers, who may not have access to conventional mortgage finance. The housing units will consist of various typologies, ranging from one-bedroom apartments to four-bedroom blocks of flats and price range will depend on the location and house type. REDAN President, Dr Aliyu Wamako, told The Guardian that a comprehensive business plan for RUHI-774 has been developed and members loan applications submitted to Shelter Afrique as part of measures to execute the project. He disclosed that the scheme was part of REDAN’s effort to complement government efforts in the provision of housing for Nigerians. He said: “All the applicants have been profiled and a bank guarantee is about to be issued to Shelter Afrique for them to release the money. We can bring Shelter Afrique to deposit a cheque of about $100 million, which was changed to naira through the Stock Exchange Commission. And based on that, they have a deposit of about N47 billion in Nigeria. It is out of this money they are going to give out to loan REDAN members for the construction of these houses. REDAN is proposing about N12 to N20 billion to finance the project. The project is designed to be energy-efficient, eco-friendly and smart, with features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and biogas plants. It would also use alternative building technologies and materials that are locally sourced and produced, among others. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

       "   'content': \"Three bank stocks – United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), FBN Holdings Plc and Guaranty Trust Holding Company Plc – (measured by volume) dominated activities in the equities sector of Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) last week, contributing 72.3 per cent to activities. With the contribution, the financial sector maintained its dominance in volume terms with 1.1 billion shares valued at N18.908 billion traded in 19,424 deals, thus contributing 72.27 per cent to the total equity turnover. On the price movement chart, positive sentiments returned to the local bourse last week as investors re-entered the market, despite profit-taking activities on banking stocks earlier in the week, The improved performance was occasioned by bargain hunting in BUAFoods (+20.8 per cent), Airtel Africa (+10 per cent) and Geregu (+33.3 per cent). As a result, the NGX All-Share Index and market capitalisation appreciated by 3.79 per cent to close the week at 105,722.78 and N57.85 trillion respectively. Similarly, all other indices finished higher except NGX CG, NGX Banking, NGX AFR Bank Value, NGX AFR Div Yield, NGX MERI Growth, NGX Industrial Goods, NGX Growth and NGX Sovereign Bond, which depreciated by 0.18 per cent, 1.34 per cent, 3.32 per cent, 0.32 per cent, 3.43 per cent, 1.83 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 0.02 per cent with the MTD and YTD returns increasing to +4.5 per cent and +41.4 per cent, respectively. Specifically, trading in the top three banks accounted for 389.286 million shares worth N11.757 billion in 5,372 deals, contributing 24.96 per cent to the total equity turnover. Following the banking sector last week was the conglomerate industry with 117 million shares worth N1.5 billion in 2,775 deals. The consumer goods sector ranked third with a turnover of 98.4 million shares worth N4 billion in 6,322 deals. Overall, the total turnover of 1.6 billion shares worth N36.4 billion was recorded in 42,546 deals by investors on the floor of the Exchange, in contrast to a total of 2.4 billion units valued at N47.9 billion that was exchanged in 54,982 deals on February 9, 2024. Reacting to market performance, analysts at Cordros Capital said: “In the coming week, we expect sentiments to be determined by the movement of yields in the fixed-income market. “Also, as we move towards the earnings season, further earnings releases and possible dividend declarations may be the catalysts for another spurt of positive sentiment which supports buying activities on the bourse.” Investdata Consulting Limited said: “Nigeria’s heightening inflation is more of a structural problem, especially with the worsening depreciation of the Naira, leading to imported inflation and hike in food prices due to the high level of insecurity that has kept farmers away from their farmlands. “With this high inflation figure, expect a rate hike from the MPC meeting, even as the earnings reporting season enters its peak with dividend expectations, while market players continue to reassess opportunities in the financial market. “We expect mixed sentiment to continue as players digest the January Consumer Price Index of 29.9 per cent, profit taking and portfolio repositioning ahead of the fixed income market activities next week and audited corporate earnings with dividend expectations. “This is amidst the volatility and upcoming policy meeting, while pullback at this point will add more strength to upside potential. As such, investors should take advantage of price correction. Also looking at the trends and events across the globe and domestically.” A total of 639,482 units of exchange-traded products (ETPs) valued at N638.5 million were traded last week in 24 deals compared with a total of 69,544 units valued at N67 million transacted last week in 35 deals.

       " 'Bill Gates, an election official in,that he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress from the threats that came along with his job.\\n But he doesn’t want to focus on that. The soon-to-be retired Maricopa county supervisor wants to talk about his new role, training the next generation of elections officials.\\n “I don’t love how every article, and I know this one will too, says ‘Bill Gates has been diagnosed with PTSD.’ I don’t want to be known by this experience that I’ve had, but I think it’s too important, and I don’t regret it for a second that I did tell this story,” he said.\\n Gates oversees elections as part of a five-member board in Maricopa county,– the state’s largest county, which includes Phoenix and is known for close elections and election denialism.\\n Gates, a Republican, decided not to run for the board again, and his term ends early next year. But he won’t be leaving elections entirely. He will help start a new lab at Arizona State University (ASU) to focus on elections and democracy issues, called the Mechanics of Democracy Laboratory. He will help teach current and hopeful election administrators, with the goal to start a degree or certificate program. The lab will also host events and trainings on these issues, in a county where the threats to democracy aren’t soon fading away.\\n “There’s no better place to do it than in Maricopa county, where so much of this has gone down,” he said.\\n He’s one of many elections officials who have faced a rise in threats and harassment since 2020. After Joe Biden won the 2020 election in Arizona and again after Donald Trump-allied candidates lost key races statewide in 2022, Gates. One person who threatened to poison him wasto three years of probation earlier this year. The threats factored into, but were not the deciding factor, in Gates’s decision not to seek another term.\\n Maricopa county’s board of supervisors and recorder’s office will seeofficials leave their positions, either by choice or through electoral losses. Four of the five board members and the recorder are all Republicans who stood up to pressure campaigns to overturn the results by Trump and his allies after 2020. Already, community members have shown harassing behavior at board meetings this election cycle, leading to.\\n Gates says he often hears from people seeking jobs running elections, a field that in decades past has been one people fell into.\\n “This is the opportunity to really take the spark of interest that’s out there, and really germinate it and help develop it into a great career for people, because it really is,” he said. “Everyone who’s in elections loves it, not withstanding the challenges of the past few years.”\\n After 15 years between Phoenix city council and the board of supervisors, that’s a lot of time in elected office, and especially after our experience the last four years. It was kind of a remarkable run and to work on such important issues, you do have to know, OK, this is the right time to move on.\\n It has been reported that I’m running away because of death threats or whatever, and that’s simply not the case. It’s a lot more complicated decision-making than just that. But I’m very at peace with my decision and excited.\\n I wouldn’t be fair to say that it didn’t play any role, because certainly, being an elected official at the local level in Maricopa county has changed a lot in the last 15 years. So I would say it was a factor, but it wasn’t the driving factor or the deciding factor.\\n I don’t get sick of it, because I think it’s important that we talk about it, that people are aware of it. It’s important that we not normalize this. I am concerned, though, that sometimes, I don’t want that to always be the story. I want the story to be about our elections team and the great work that they’re doing, or maybe identifying certain things that we want to make sure people are aware of.\\n Probably the number one issue that we’re looking at for ouris the fact that our ballot is going to be on two pages, so actually two sheets of paper. And so we want to make sure that people understand that going into it, that they basically budget the time needed to review all of these. I just want to make sure that those types of messages are not getting lost.\\n It was not an easy decision to make, but I knew that there were hundreds, if not thousands, of elections officials across the country who are dealing with the same issues. And elections administrators, elections officials generally, are people who keep their head down, they don’t want to be part of the story, and I’m very grateful for that, I think that’s important. But I also thought that by raising my voice, others who are involved in this would see that and maybe say, hey, you know, I’m experiencing those same things, get a little bit of strength from that.\\n And then also, we can’t normalize this. I deal with this. Other elections officials have dealt with this for years, and sometimes you feel like everyone else knows – they don’t.\\n But look, honestly, I don’t love how every article, and I know this one will too, says ‘Bill Gates has been diagnosed with PTSD.’ I don’t want to be known by this experience that I’ve had, but I think it’s too important, and I don’t regret it for a second that I did tell this story. I was really speaking to others in elections, but I’ve been overwhelmed by the number of people who’ve reached out to me and shared the trauma that they’ve experienced in other professional environments, some of them certainly your more traditional folks, veterans or first responders, but even people who have experienced trauma in the workplace in a corporate environment, that this resonated for some reason, and they reached out to me.\\n Yeah, most definitely. God willing, we’ll move on from this, and there’ll be a time when this will be a memory, but I hope that these stories can live on. People need to know that this happened in our country so that hopefully we can keep it from ever happening again.\\n There’s been no better time to get into elections administration. People know how important it is, how democracy really depends on it and having good people in it. If you want to make a lot of money, I don’t recommend it, it’s not the profession – but if you want to make a difference at the most fundamental level of democracy, this is the place to do it.\\n I do. Yes. This is my party, the party I joined in the late 1980s, and I have no intention of leaving it, even though the priorities of many elected officials of the party are not those that I have, and certainly not those that I brought to this party when I joined it. But I’m not leaving.\\n People need to understand, elected officials and people who are working in politics, that either raising money or maybe even getting votes in the short term off of pushing election conspiracies will, long-term, continue to do great harm to our system, and our system can’t take that. It’s going to require some responsibility by those in office.\\n If we think that we’re going to go back to the way things used to be in two years, that’s not realistic. There’s been too much damage that’s been done to the trust that people have in our system. So that’s why I think this is the best way that I can spend my time, by working with that next generation, educating them, and not only the next generation, but even those who might be a little more seasoned, who choose to come to Arizona State University to take a class and learn more about the system. It’s a long-term effort to continue to debunk and, in some cases, pre-bunk the conspiracies, because with information, I think that can only help to improve the situation.\\n',\n",
